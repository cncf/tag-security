# Cloud native security day

One of the things we do as a community is Cloud Native Security day,
designed to bring together the cloud native security community
together to discuss and share current challenges and solutions
in cloud native security to get together in a vendor neutral space.

Cloud Native Security Day (#cnsecurityday) is intended to
drive collaboration, discussion, and knowledge sharing of
cloud native security accomplishments and roadblocks. Get
connected with others that are passionate about security.
Learn from practitioners about pitfalls to avoid, hurdles to
jump, and how to integrate security into your cloud native
project, architecture, and enhance team awareness on security.
