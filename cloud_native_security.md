# Cloud native security day
One of the things we do as a community is a Cloud Native Security day, it is designed to bring together the cloud native security community together to discuss and share current challenges and solutions in cloud native security to get together in a vendor neutral space.

Cloud Native Security Day (#cnsecurityday) is intended to drive collaboration, discussion, and knowledge sharing of cloud native security accomplishments and roadblocks. Get connected with others that are passionate about security. Learn from practitioners about pitfalls to avoid, hurdles to jump, and how to integrate security into your cloud native project, architecture, and enhance team awareness on security.
