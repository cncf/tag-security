# First time contributors

We happily welcome our new contributors to this
community. If you are contributing to CNCF
for the first time it is okay if you
to feel overwhelmed. We as a community
are always there to help you with any problems
you are facing. Open-source is about
collaboration and we are always there
for supporting each other.

## Getting involved and contributing

As a beginner or first timer, you might find
difficulties in understanding where to start
from. Don't worry! We got you.

In the interest of getting more new people
involved we have issues marked as
[good-first-issues]. These are issues that have smaller
scope, but are a great way to start with and
getting acquainted with the project.

The good-first-issues should also provide
you details on how to get things resolved or
how to proceed. If you find it is missing or
incomplete please tag the person who created
the issue and let them know.

## Before your first PR
