## Security Issues

This group engages in [security reviews](../assessments/README.md) of projects to
assist in improving their overall security posture. As part of those reviews,
members may find or discuss potential issues. These findings and discussions
(verbal, slack, or draft doc) are not regarded as a verified vulnerability and
must adhere to the project's security reporting process. It is critical that
contributions from security reviews remain close held to ensure adherence to a
given project's responsible security disclosures process should an potential
issue be discovered.

Presentations on security issues prior or during active engagement with projects
is not permitted as these may be under embargo. If you are interested in
presenting on a potential security issues we request you contact the project and
get concurrence _prior_ to submitting a presentation issue to our repo. If you
are interested in presenting on security issues discovered as a result of a
security review, please refer to [use of a completed
package](../assessments/README.md#use-of-a-completed-package) for how that
content may be used.
