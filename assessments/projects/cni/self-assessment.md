# Self-assessment
The Self-assessment is the initial document for projects to begin thinking about the
security of the project, determining gaps in their security, and preparing any security
documentation for their users. This document is ideal for projects currently in the
CNCF **sandbox** as well as projects that are looking to receive a joint assessment and
currently in CNCF **incubation**.

## Overview
**Container Network Interface** <br>
CNI, a project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, includes a set of guidelines and software libraries
used for developing plugins that set up network interfaces within Linux and Windows containers. Its primary goal
is managing container network connectivity and deallocating resources once a container is removed. This specific
focus has led to broad support for CNI and a straightforward implementation process due to its simple specification.

### Background
With the rapid development of application containers on Linux, networking in this area is still not well addressed
as it is highly environment-specific. To deal with this problem, developers seek to create a network layer that is
pluggable for container runtimes. Ultimately, CNI, along with libraries for Go and a set of plugins, was introduced
as a common interface between network plugins and container execution.

### Actors
These are the individual parts of your system that interact to provide the
desired functionality.  Actors only need to be separate, if they are isolated
in some way.  For example, if a service has a database and a front-end API, but
if a vulnerability in either one would compromise the other, then the distinction
between the database and front-end is not relevant.

The means by which actors are isolated should also be described, as this is often
what prevents an attacker from moving laterally after a compromise.

The following are the actors found in CNI project:
- **CNI Plugin**: A program that applies a specified network configuration. It interfaces with a variety of networking solutions to provide flexible networking capabilities.
- **Container**: A network isolation domain, though the actual isolation technology is not defined by the specification.
- **Container Runtime**: Is responsible for executing CNI plugins. It interacts with plugins to apply network configurations to individual containers.
- **Network**: A group of endpoints that are uniquely addressable that can communicate amongst each other. This could be either an individual container (as specified above), a machine, or some other network device (e.g. a router). Containers can be conceptually added to or removed from one or more networks.It includes configuration data such as IP addresses, routing rules, and network policies.

### Actions
These are the steps that a project performs in order to provide some service
or functionality.  These steps are performed by different actors in the system.
Note, that an action need not be overly descriptive at the function call level.
It is sufficient to focus on the security checks performed, use of sensitive
data, and interactions between actors to perform an action.

For example, the access server receives the client request, checks the format,
validates that the request corresponds to a file the client is authorized to
access, and then returns a token to the client.  The client then transmits that
token to the file server, which, after confirming its validity, returns the file.

#### Action Overview
1. A format for administrators defines network configurations
2. A protocol for container runtimes makes requests to network plugins with parameters from environment variables and network configuration
3. With the supplied configuration, a procedure executes the plugins.
4. CNI plugins may also have a procedure to delegate functionality to other plugins
5. Data types for plugins return their results to the runtime

#### Action 1: Network Configuration Format
CNI defines a network configuration format for administrators. It contains directives for both the container runtime as well as the plugins
to consume. At plugin execution time, this configuration format is interpreted by the runtime and transformed in to a form to be passed to the plugins.
- **Example configuration**:
  <br>
  <div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="docs/CNI-config.png" alt="CNI config">
  </div>
  <br>

#### Action 2: Execution Protocol
The CNI protocol is based on execution of binaries invoked by the container runtime. CNI defines the protocol between the plugin binary and the runtime. CNI defines 4 operations: ADD, DEL, CHECK, and VERSION. These are passed to the plugin via the CNI_COMMAND environment variable.

#### Action 3: Execution of Network Configurations
A container time interprets a network configuration and executes plugins accordingly. A runtime can add, delete, or check a network configuration in a container, which results in a series of plugin ADD, DELETE, or CHECK executions correspondingly.

#### Action 4: Plugin Delegation
There are some operations that, for whatever reason, cannot reasonably be implemented as a discrete chained plugin. Rather, a CNI plugin may wish to delegate some functionality to another plugin. One common example of this is IP address management.

#### Action 5: Result Types
Plugins can return one of three result types:
* Success
* Error
* _Version

### Goals
The intended goals of the projects including the security guarantees the project
 is meant to provide <br>
* CNI defines a common interface between the network plugins and container execution
* CNI is language-agnostic and a vendor-neutral specification
* Backwards compatible: plugins are able to easily implement all versions of the specification and some helper code is available to convert between versions.

### Non-goals
Non-goals that a reasonable reader of the projectâ€™s literature could believe may
be in scope <br>
* Dynamic updates to existing network configurations
* Dynamic policies for network bandwidth and firewall rules


## Self-assessment use

This self-assessment is created by the CNI team to perform an internal analysis of the
project's security.  It is not intended to provide a security audit of CNI, or
function as an independent assessment or attestation of CNI's security health.

This document serves to provide CNI users with an initial understanding of
CNI's security, where to find existing security documentation, CNI plans for
security, and general overview of CNI security practices, both for development of
CNI as well as security of CNI.

This document provides the CNCF TAG-Security with an initial understanding of CNI
to assist in a joint-assessment, necessary for projects under incubation.  Taken
together, this document and the joint-assessment serve as a cornerstone for if and when
CNI seeks graduation and is preparing for a security audit.

## Security functions and features

- **Critical:**
    - As documented in the [required keys for plugin configuration objects](https://www.cni.dev/docs/spec/#plugin-configuration-objects), the 'type' string containing the name of a CNI plugin cannot contain disallowed characters in file paths (e.g., '/' or '\\'). Disallowing such characters prevents using characters such as "../" to references binaries elsewhere on the system.
- **Security relevant:**
    - As documented in the [protocol parameters passed to plugins](https://www.cni.dev/docs/spec/#parameters), the environment variable CNI_PATH contains the list of paths to search for CNI plugin executables. This limits where CNI can look which could prevent unintended binaries from being executed.

## Project compliance

CNI does not document meeting any particular security standards or sub-sections.

## Secure development practices

### Development Pipeline
* Contributions are made via GitHub pull requests
* Contributors must sign off their commits which indicates they agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin ([DCO](https://www.cni.dev/docs/dco/))
* There is a test suite provided that should be run for any new features or bug fixes.
* Pull requests should include tests for new code and old code
* Pull requests trigger workflows (maintainer approval required). The jobs covered include:
	* Linting
	* Building on all linux architectures
	* Running tests on Linux amd64
	* Building and running tests on Windows
* In general, pull requests are merged once one or two maintainers endorse it.

## Appendix

### Known Issues Over Time

[**CVE-2021-20206**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20206) (CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.2 High Severity) Arbitrary path injection via type field in CNI configuration
A path name flaw allowed execution of binaries elsewhere on the system including binaries that are not CNI plugins. This was fixed in libcni version 0.8.1 by [tightening up the plugin-finding logic](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/pull/808).

### CII Best Practices

[**Current Progress**](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/2446) (Last updated January 2021):
- CNI does not meet a passing level (only 72% of the way there)
- Progress should be updated as there are currently several practices marked with â€˜?â€™
- There are no primary developers identified as having knowledge of designing secure software or preventing and handling vulnerabilities.
- They do not use static code analyzers to automatically catch vulnerabilities in code.
