# Threat Modeling with STRIDE

**1. Spoofing**

**Threat:** An attacker could impersonate a legitimate etcd member to gain unauthorized access to the cluster or disrupt its operation.

**Mitigation:**

- Implement strong authentication mechanisms: per-connection based authentication.
- tilize secure communication channels (e.g., TLS) for node-to-node and client-to-node communication.
- Regularly monitor and audit authentication logs.

**2. Tampering**

**Threat:** An attacker could modify etcd data or code to alter its behavior or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Mitigation:**

- Use MVCC database (boltdb) to store multiple version of the data concurrently
- Use strong per-connection based authentication method to validate each request

**3. Repudiation**

**Threat:** An attacker could modify data or code and then deny that they made the changes.

**Mitigation:**

- Implement immutable and tamper-evident logging mechanisms.
- Use digital signatures to verify the integrity of log entries.
- Replicate data, code and logs among multiple machines in distributed system. Modifying data on a particular machine cannot result in presistent change.

**4. Information Disclosure**

**Threat:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in etcd, such as passwords or API keys.

**Mitigation:**

- Implement data encryption to protect sensitive information at rest and in transit. This can be achieved using AES 256-bit encryption or equivalent.

- Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data. This includes using role-based access control (RBAC) to grant users only the minimum level of access they need to perform their duties.

**5. Denial-of-Service (DoS)**

**Threat:** An attacker could overwhelm etcd's resources with excessive requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Mitigation:**

- Implement resource quotas to limit the number of requests that a single member or client can make. This can help prevent an attacker from consuming all of etcd's resources and causing a DoS attack.

- Implement rate limiting to slow down excessive requests. This can help prevent an attacker from flooding etcd with requests and overwhelming its servers.

**6. Elevation of Privilege**

**Threat:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to a higher level of privilege within the etcd cluster, such as elevated permissions to modify data or control the cluster's operation.

**Mitigation:**

- Implement strong access control mechanisms to restrict access to privileged operations. This can include using RBAC and the principle of least privilege to grant users only the minimum level of access they need.

- Ensure that etcd is configured securely, with all unnecessary ports closed and strong passwords used for all accounts.

- Regularly audit etcd access logs to detect any suspicious activity that could indicate an unauthorized privilege escalation attack.
