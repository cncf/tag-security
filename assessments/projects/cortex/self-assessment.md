## Overview

Cortex is an open source horizontally scalable microservices-based system designed for handling and storing time-series data. It is specifically tailored for Prometheus, a popular monitoring and alerting toolkit in cloud-native environments. Cortex extends Prometheus by providing long-term storage, horizontal scalability, and multi-tenancy support.

### Background

Cortex serves as a remote storage backend for Prometheus instances. It receives time-series data (samples) from Prometheus, stores them in a scalable manner, and facilitates efficient querying of this data. The typical usage involves deploying Cortex alongside Prometheus to enable long-term storage, scalability, and multi-tenancy features. It is commonly used in environments where monitoring and analyzing time-series data at scale are crucial, such as in cloud-native applications.

### Actors

- **Prometheus:** This is the primary actor that scrapes samples from various targets and sends them to Cortex using Prometheus' remote write API.

- **Block Storage:** Based on Prometheus TSDB, stores each tenant's time series data into their own TSDB, using on-disk blocks with chunks and block indexes. Handles storage requirements for time-series data in Cortex.

- **Distributor:** Handles incoming samples from Prometheus, validates them, and distributes them to multiple ingesters. Utilizes consistent hashing for distribution.

- **Ingester:** Responsible for writing incoming series to a long-term storage backend, managing the lifecycle of series, and handling replication and write-ahead logs for fault tolerance.

- **Querier:** Handles queries using the PromQL query language, fetching series samples from ingesters and long-term storage, and deduplicating samples as needed.

- **Compactor:** Compacts multiple blocks of a given tenant into a single optimized block, reducing storage costs and increasing query speed.

- **Store Gateway:** Queries series from blocks, keeping an up-to-date view of the storage bucket.

- **Query Frontend:** Provides API endpoints for queries, accelerates the read path, and manages internal queues for query processing.

- **Query Scheduler:** Moves the internal queue from the query frontend into a separate component, enabling independent scaling of query frontends and schedulers.

- **Ruler:** Executes PromQL queries for recording rules and alerts, requiring a database storing the recording rules and alerts for each tenant.

- **Alertmanager:** Accepts alert notifications from the ruler, deduplicates and groups them, and routes them to the correct notification channels. Requires a database storing per-tenant configuration.

- **Configs API:** Manages the configuration of rulers and alert managers, providing APIs to get/set/update configurations and store them in a backend.

### Actions

#### Data Ingestion:
1. Prometheus: Scrapes time-series samples and sends them to Cortex using remote write API.
2. Distributor: Validates and distributes incoming samples to ingesters via consistent hashing.

#### Ingestion and Storage:
1. Ingester: Writes incoming series to long-term storage.
2. Block Storage: Stores time series in tenant-specific TSDB, using on-disk blocks with chunks and block indexes.

#### Query Handling:
1. Querier: Handles PromQL queries, fetching series samples from ingesters and storage.
2. Store Gateway: Queries series from blocks, maintaining an updated view of the storage bucket.

#### Optimization:
1. Compactor: Optimizes storage by compacting multiple blocks for a given tenant, reducing storage costs and enhancing query speed.

#### Optional Components:
1. Query Frontend: Provides API endpoints, accelerates read path, and manages internal queues for query processing.
2. Query Scheduler: Manages the internal queue for queries, enabling independent scaling.
3. Ruler (Optional): Executes PromQL queries for recording rules and alerts, utilizing a database for rule storage.
4. Alertmanager (Optional): Accepts, deduplicates, and routes alert notifications based on configurations.
5. Configs API (Optional): Manages configuration for rulers and alert managers.

#### High Availability and Consistency:
1. Distributor HA Tracker: Deduplicates incoming samples from redundant Prometheus servers, ensuring consistency.
2. Consistent Hashing: Distributors use consistent hashing for series distribution among ingesters.
3. Quorum Consistency: Achieves Dynamo-style quorum consistency on reads and writes for reliability.

#### Scalability:
1. Horizontal Scaling: Cortex components can scale horizontally to handle increasing workloads.
2. Load Balancing: Random load balancing of write requests across distributor instances.

#### Fault Tolerance:
1. Replication and Write-Ahead Log: Mitigates data loss by replicating in-memory series and utilizing write-ahead logs in case of ingester failures.

### Goals
- Cortex aims to run across a cluster of machines, handling metrics from multiple Prometheus servers and supporting globally aggregated queries.
- In a cluster setup, Cortex replicates data between machines to ensure high availability in the face of machine failures.

### Non-goals
- Cortex does not aim to serve as a general-purpose database for various data types, focusing specifically on Prometheus metrics.
- Cortex may not prioritize real-time processing or streaming of data, as its primary function is long-term, durable storage of metric data.

## Self-assessment use

This self-assessment is created by the Cortex team to perform an internal analysis of Cortex's security. It is not intended to provide a security audit of Cortex or function as an independent assessment or attestation of Cortex's security health.

This document serves to provide Cortex users with an initial understanding of Cortex's security, where to find existing security documentation, Cortex plans for security, and a general overview of Cortex security practices, both for the development of Cortex as well as the security of Cortex.

This document provides the CNCF TAG-Security with an initial understanding of Cortex to assist in a joint-assessment, necessary for projects under incubation. Taken together, this document and the joint-assessment serve as a cornerstone for if and when Cortex seeks graduation and is preparing for a security audit.
