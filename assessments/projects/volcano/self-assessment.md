## Overview

Volcano is a cloud native batch scheduling system for compute-intensive workloads

### Background

Volcano is a batch system built on Kubernetes. It provides a suite of mechanisms that are commonly required by many classes of batch & elastic workload including: machine learning/deep learning, bioinformatics/genomics and other "big data" applications. These types of applications typically run on generalized domain frameworks like TensorFlow, Spark, Ray, PyTorch, MPI, etc, which Volcano integrates with.

Volcano builds upon a decade and a half of experience running a wide variety of high performance workloads at scale using several systems and platforms, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the open source community.

Until June 2021, Volcano has been widely used around the world at a variety of industries such as Internet/Cloud/Finance/Manufacturing/Medical. More than 20 companies or institutions are not only end users but also active contributors. Hundreds of contributors are taking active part in the code commit/PR review/issue discussion/docs update and design provision.

Volcano is an incubating project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
