### Threat Modelling Notes

Chaos Mesh is an open-source cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform that offers various types of fault simulation and has an enormous capability to orchestrate fault scenarios. It can be installed in a test environment using a script, or in a production environment using Helm (recommended).

### Data Dictionary

- The type of data stored can be:
  - Chaos Experiments: This includes information about the type of chaos experiment, the target (e.g., pod, network), and the parameters of the experiment.
  - Workflows: This includes information about the steps of the experiment, the entry point of the workflow, and the conditions for the experiments.
  - HTTP Requests: This includes information about the HTTP requests sent during the execution of workflows
- Classification/Sensitivity: High

### Control Families

#### Deployment Architecture
- **Control**: Managed through Kubernetes with defined storage classes and volume claims. Chaos Mesh uses Kubernetes for its deployment architecture. It also provides the ability to control the scope of Chaos experiments to specific namespaces
- **Data**: Persistent volume data.
- **Threats**: Misconfiguration leading to unauthorized access.

#### Networking
- **Control**: Chaos Mesh can simulate network-related faults, such as delay and packet loss. Internal Kubernetes networking with CNI, optional TLS encryption for external communication.
- **Data**: Data packets.
- **Threats**: Data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks.

#### Multi-tenancy Isolation
- **Control**: Kubernetes namespaces and compliant to RBAC.
- **Data**: Managing permissions.
- **Threats**: Access or attacks across tenants

#### Secrets Management
- **Control**: Integration with Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive information management.
- **Data**: public/private keys, user credentials.
- **Threats**: Exposure/alter of sensitive data.

#### Authentication and Authorization
- **Control**: RBAC Authorization to manage permissions.
- **Data**: apiGroups of chaos-mesh.org
- **Threats**: Unauthorized activities occurring within the storage system/networks.

#### Audit and logging
- **Control**: logr and zap for logging
- **Data**: structured/leveled logs.
- **Threats**: Lack of coverage/visibility, not have correlation Ids to map.

#### Security Tests
- **Control**: Integration tests and testing on test environment with changes.
- **Data**: Code and dependencies.
- **Threats**: vulnerabilities, wrong test cases, less coverage leading to unexpected results.

### Threat Scenarios
Chaos Mesh is designed to be used in a Kubernetes environment, and it provides various types of fault simulations. Therefore, potential threats could include:

#### External Attacker without access to the project at runtime or its hosting: 
- **Threats**: This could involve an attacker trying to inject faults into the system or access sensitive information.
- **Control**: Implement robust input validation and output encoding to mitigate injection attacks. Employ encryption for sensitive information stored and transmitted. Robust authentication mechanisms. Introduce Firewall rules.
#### External Attacker with valid access to the project at runtime: 
- **Threats**: This could involve an attacker trying to manipulate the Chaos experiments or the workflows.
- **Control**: Utilize strong authentication mechanisms and access controls. Employ monitoring and anomaly detection to identify unusual activities.
#### Internal Attacker with access to hosting environment (cluster or provider): 
- **Threats**: This could involve an attacker trying to manipulate the Chaos experiments or the workflows. Apply strict RBAC policies.
- **Control**: Apply strict access controls and segregation of duties within the hosting environment. Regularly audit and monitor access logs for any unauthorized activities.
#### Malicious Internal User: 
- **Threats**: This could involve a user trying to manipulate the Chaos experiments or the workflows.
- **Controls**: Enforce least privilege access controls, limiting access to necessary functionalities. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious behavior promptly. Conduct regular user training on security protocols and best practices.

### Recommendations:
- Avoid using depreciated library versions and services.
- All sensitive data must encrypted and usage of secret manager is much much more secure for both transport and application layer.
- Periodically assess the issues and vulnerability from logs and contributors.

### Conclusion:
- Chaos Mesh is a powerful tool for Chaos Engineering, but it's important to consider potential threats and implement appropriate controls. However, to further analyze complex threats, advanced threat modeling tools must be used.
