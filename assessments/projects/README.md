# Security TAG Reviews
This directory contains the artifacts of Security TAG's various assessments and
reviews of projects. Information on the processes to by which these artifacts
are produced can be found in the [guide](/assessments/guide).

Note that the process has changed slightly over time, so please see the individual 
project directory for information about what type of assessment was performed.  

Note also, that some of the self-assessments were created by Security Pals, who are 
external parties that review the project's documentation to create an assessment 
draft.  These may not have been reviewed by the project team.
