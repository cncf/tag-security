# Security Assessments

The [security assessment process](guide) is designed to accelerate the adoption 
of cloud native technologies, based on the following assumptions:
1. Reduce risk across the ecosystem
   A. Clear and consistent process for communication increases detection & 
   reduces time to resolve known or suspected vulnerability issues
   B. A collaborative evaluation process increases domain expertise 
   within each participating project.
2. Accelerate adoption of cloud native technologies (via discovery of security information & streamlined security reviews)
   A. Consistent documentation reduces review time 
   B. Established baseline of security-relevant information reduces Q&A
   C. Clear rubric for security profile enables organizations to align their 
   risk profile with projectâ€™s risk profile and effectively allocate resources 
   (for review and needed project contribution)  
   D. Structured metadata allows for navigation, grouping and cross-linking

## Goal
The purpose of this effort is to reduce the risk of malicious attacks and 
accidental breaches of privacy by raising awareness of how specific open source 
projects affect the security of a cloud native system.

Each project assessment will:
1. ensure a clear description of the project's design goals with respect to 
security
2. uncover design flaws and document known limitations
3. document next steps toward increasing security of the project itself and/or 
increasing the applications of the project toward increasing security of the 
cloud native ecosystem
