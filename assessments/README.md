# Security Assessments

## Goals

The [security assessment process](guide) is designed to accelerate the adoption
of cloud native technologies, based on the following goals and assumptions:

### 1) Reduce risk across the ecosystem

The primary goal is to reduce the risk from malicious attacks and accidental
breaches of privacy. This process supports that goal in two ways:

   * Clear and consistent process for communication increases detection &
     reduces time to resolve known or suspected vulnerability issues
   * A collaborative evaluation process increases domain expertise within each
     participating project.

### 2) Accelerate adoption of cloud native technologies

Security reviews are a necessary, time intensive process. Each company,
organization and project must perform its own reviews to ensure that it meets
its unique commitments to its own users and stakeholders. In open source, simply
finding security-related information can be overwhelmingly difficult and a time
consuming part of the security review. The CNCF security assessment, hereafter
"security assessment," process is intended to enable improved discovery of
security information & assist in streamlining internal and external security
reviews in multiple ways:

   * Consistent documentation reduces review time
   * Established baseline of security-relevant information reduces Q&A
   * Clear rubric for security profile enables organizations to align their risk
     profile with the project’s risk profile and effectively allocate resources
     (for review and needed project contribution)
   * Structured metadata allows for navigation, grouping and cross-linking

We expect that this process will raise awareness of how specific open source
projects affect the security of a cloud native system; however, separate
activities may be needed to achieve that purpose using materials generated by
the assessements.

## Outcome

Each project's security assessment shall include a description of:
1. the project's design goals with respect to security
2. any aspects of design and configuration that could introduce risk
3. known limitations, such as expectations or assumptions that aspects of
   security, whole or in part, are to be handled by upstream or downstream
   dependencies or complementary software
4. next steps toward increasing security of the project itself and/or increasing
   the applications of the project toward a more secure cloud native ecosystem

Due to the nature and timeframe for the analysis, *this review is not meant to
subsume the need for a professional security audit of the code*.  Audits of
implementation-specific vulnerabilities, improper deployment configurations, etc.
are not in scope of a security assessment.  A security assessment is intended to
uncover design flaws and to obtain a clear, comprehensive
articulation of the project's design goals and aspirations while documenting the
intended security properties enforced, fulfilled, or executed by said project.

Finalized assessments may be used by the community to assist in contextual evaluation of a  project but are not an endorsement of the security of the project, not a security audit of the project, and do not relieve an individual or organization from performing due diligence and complying with laws, regulations, and policies.

Draft assessments contain *unconfirmed* content and are not endorsed as factual until committed to this repository, which requires detailed peer review.  Draft assessments may also contain *speculative* content as the project lead or security reviewer is performing an evaluation.  Draft assessments are *only* for the purpose of preparing final assessment and are **not** to be used in any other capacity by the community.

Final slides resulting from a project's security assessment will be stored in the individual project's assessment folder with supporting documentation from the assessment.  These folders can be found under [assessments/projects](projects/) and clicking on the project name.

## Process

The security assessment is a collaborative process for the benefit of the
project and the community, where the primary content is generated by the
[project lead](guide/project-lead.md) and revised based on feedback from
[security reviewers](guide/security-reviewer.md) and other members of the SIG.


* If you are interested in a security assessment for your project and you are
  willing to volunteer as [project lead](guide/project-lead.md) or you are a
  SIG-Security member and want to recommend a project to review, please [file an
  issue](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/issues/new?assignees=&labels=assessment&template=security-assessment.md&title=%5BAssessment%5D+Project+Name)

See [security assessment guide](guide) for more details.  To understand how we
prioritize reviews, see [intake process](./intake-process.md).

### CNCF and TOC process alignment

**Sandbox** The _self-assessment artifact_ is first created while the project
is in the **sandbox**.  It is the starting point for projects to consider their security health.

**Incubation** If a self-assessment artifact was not created during sandbox,
it may be created as part of **incubation**.  It is the starting point for 
projects to consider their security health.  The _joint-review artifact_ 
must be created during **incubation** (if not before).
It leverages the information from the self-assessment and assists projects in 
becoming more security mature and increasing awareness of their security
features across the community.

**Graduation** When the project undergoes a CNCF security audit,
the information from the self-assessment and joint-review are incredibly useful
for auditors.  Both of these artifacts also assist security teams with a
comprehensive understanding of the threat and risk posture of the project.
