# TAG-Security Security Assessment (TSSA) Process 

## Goals

The [TAG-Security Security Assessment Process](guide) (formerly the security 
review process) is designed to accelerate the adoption of cloud native 
technologies based on the below goals and assumptions:

### 1) Reduce risk across the ecosystem

The primary goal is to minimize the risk of malicious attacks and accidental privacy
breaches. This process achieves this in two ways:

   * Improve detection and resolution of vulnerabilities through a clear communication
     process.
   * Enhance domain expertise in participating projects via collaborative assessments.

### 2) Accelerate adoption of cloud native technologies

Security assessments are essential but time-intensive processes that each company, 
organization, and project must perform to meet their unique commitments to users and 
stakeholders. In open source, finding security-related information can be overwhelmingly 
difficult and time-consuming. The CNCF TAG-Security Security Assessment Process, hereafter 
“TSSA” Process, aims to enhance the discovery of security information and streamline 
internal and external assessments in multiple ways:

   * Consistent documentation to reduce assessment time.
   * Baseline of security information to minimize Q&A.
   * A clear security profile rubric for organizations to align their risk profiles with
     the project’s and allocate resources effectively (for assessment and needed project
     contribution).
   * Structured metadata for navigation, grouping, and cross-linking.

This process is expected to raise awareness of how open source projects impact cloud native security; 
however, separate activities may be needed to achieve that purpose using materials generated by
the TSSA, known as artifacts or the TSSA package.

## Outcome

Each project's TSSA package shall include a description of the project's:
1. Security design goals.
2. Potential risks in design and configuration implementations.
3. Known limitations, including expectations that certain security aspects are managed by
   upstream or downstream dependencies or complementary software.
5. Next steps to enhance the project's security and/or its contributions to a more secure
   cloud native ecosystem.

Due to the nature and time frame of the analysis, *the TSSA package is not 
meant to subsume the need for a professional security audit of the code*. Implementation-specific 
vulnerabilities or improper deployment configurations are not in the scope of a TSSA. 
Instead, the TSSA aims to uncover design flaws, enhance the project's security mindset, 
and clearly document its design goals and intended security properties.

### Benefits of a TSSA

Underging the TSSA Process is a key step toward eliminating security risks and integrating 
security as a fundamental aspect of your system over time.

Key benefits of TSSA include:
* Establishing a measurable security baseline.
* Identifying and analyzing security issues and their risks.
* Integrating a culture of security awareness among developers.
* Documenting procedures for future compliance, audit, and internal assessments.

### Components of the TSSA package

A complete TSSA package primarily consists of the following
items:
* [Self-assessment](guide/self-assessment.md): A written assessment by the project
of the project's current security statue.
* [Joint-assessment](guide/joint-assessment.md): A hands-on assessment by both the [security
reviewers](guide/security-reviewer.md) and the project team.  It expands upon the self-assessment
to offer a more comprehensive consideration of the project’s security health.
This artifact, alongside the self-assessment, provides invaluable indight for both
security auditors and end-users.
* [Joint README](guide/joint-readme-template.md): Review the template used by the security
reviewers to create a readme high level summary at the end of the joint assessment.
It is considered when performing due diligence.

### Use of a completed TSSA package

A finalized TSSA package may assist the community in contextual project reviews but 
it is not an endorsement or audit of the project’s security. It does not exempt individuals 
or organizations from conducting their own due diligence and complying with laws, regulations, 
and policies.

Draft assessments contain *unconfirmed* content and require peer review before being 
committed to the repository. Draft documents may also contain *speculative* content as 
the project lead or security reviewer is performing an assessment.  
Draft assessments are *only* for the purpose of preparing final artifacts and are **not** 
to be used in any other capacity by the community.

Final presentation slides and the project's joint assessment
will be stored in the individual project's folder with supporting
documentation and artifacts from the TSSA.  These folders can be found under
 [assessments/projects](projects/) by clicking on the project name.

## Process

Creating the TSSA package is a collaborative process benefitting both the project 
and the community. The primary content is generated by the [project lead](guide/project-lead.md) 
and revised based on feedback from [security reviewers](guide/security-reviewer.md)
and other members of the TAG.

* If you are interested in a TSSA for your project and you are
  willing to volunteer as [project lead](guide/project-lead.md) or you are a
  TAG-Security member and want to recommend a project to assess, please [file an
