# Security Assessments

## Goals
The [security assessment process](guide) is designed to accelerate the adoption
of cloud native technologies, based on the following goals and assumptions:

### 1) Reduce risk across the ecosystem

The primary goal is to reduce the risk from malicious attacks and accidental breaches of privacy. This process supports that goal in two ways:

   * Clear and consistent process for communication increases detection &
   reduces time to resolve known or suspected vulnerability issues
   * A collaborative evaluation process increases domain expertise
   within each participating project.

### 2) Accelerate adoption of cloud native technologies

Security reviews are a necessary, yet time consuming process, where each
company, organization and project must perform its own reviews to ensure
that it meets its unique commitments to its own users and stakeholders.
In open source, simply finding security-related information can be a very
time consuming part of the the process. The process is designed to enable improved discovery of security information & streamlined security reviews in multiple ways:

   * Consistent documentation reduces review time
   * Established baseline of security-relevant information reduces Q&A
   * Clear rubric for security profile enables organizations to align their
   risk profile with projectâ€™s risk profile and effectively allocate resources
   (for review and needed project contribution)
   * Structured metadata allows for navigation, grouping and cross-linking

We expect that this process will raise awareness of how specific open source
projects affect the security of a cloud native system; however, separate
activities may be needed to achieve that purpose using materials generated by
the assessements.

## Outcome

Each project assessment will:
1. ensure a clear description of the project's design goals with respect to
security
2. uncover design flaws and document known limitations
3. document next steps toward increasing security of the project itself and/or
increasing the applications of the project toward increasing security of the
cloud native ecosystem

Due to the nature and timeframe for the analysis, *this review is not meant
to subsume the need for a professional security audit of the code*.  Audits
of implementation vulnerabilities and similar issues at that level are not
intended to be covered by this assessment.  The purpose of this effort is to
uncover design flaws and to obtain a clear articulation of what the project's
design goals and security properties are intended to be.

## Process

The project assessment is intended to be a collaborative process for
the benefit of the project and the community, where the primary content is
generated by the [project lead](guide/project-lead.md) and revised based on feedback
from [security reviewers](guide/security-reviewer.md) and other members of the
working group (WG).

See [security assessment guide](guide) for more details.
