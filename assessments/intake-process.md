# Security Assessment Priorities & Pipeline Intake Process

SIG-Security has a volunteer team of subject matter experts and industry
professionals dedicated to helping SIG-Security members, the TOC, and the larger
CNCF community maintain an understanding of the current state of security in the
cloud native ecosystem and helping cloud native projects succeed.

The following process describes how projects are prioritized for security
assessments.

# Authority

* The [Security Assessment
  Facilitator](../governance/roles.md#security-assessment-facilitator) maintains
  the Assessment queue
* A named chair provides oversight for the Security Assessment initiative. This
  chair can adjust queue, and is also responsible for conveying TOC
  instructions, when needed. (Sarah Allen is the current named Chair for
  Security Assessments.)

# Pre-conditions

* The project is either a CNCF project OR an assertion that the project is cloud
  native (any objection must be resolved before an assessment would be
  considered)
* The project has identified a project lead and has a written self-assessment

# Intake priorities

1. TOC requests SIG-Security review a specific project or adjust priorities a.
   TOC request will not interrupt an ongoing assessment b. TOC requests may jump
   the prioritized queue of projects waiting for an assessment
2. Projects that have received a CNCF Security Audit will be reviewed within a
   year of audit.
3. CNCF Projects that request a review (or invited by SIG members). Prioritized
   by project majority (Graduated projects will be highest priority, then
   incubated projects, then sandbox.)
4. Non-CNCF Projects that request a review (or invited by SIG members)

## Updates and renewal

The Security Assessment team will review assessed projects annually, focusing
primarily on any issues or concerns raised in previous assessments, addressing
new functionality that affects risk profile of the project, and any issue that
may have been flagged about the project.
