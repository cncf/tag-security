3. *What was the most valuable artifact or portion of the process?*


## Quality

   security reviews (formerly assessments)?*


2. *For self-assessments, was the self-assessment content helpful for
   assisting in the security documentation of the project?*

## Efficiency

1. *Were there parts of the security review process that could be improved,
   such as timeliness, communication, etc.?*


2. *Are portions of the artifacts produced from this review duplicate, or better left as references
   elsewhere?*

3. *For joint reviews, if a self-assessment was performed prior to the joint
   review, was the self-assessment beneficial for the creation of the joint
review?*

## Other

    etc.) can be improved to make the experience and resulting artifacts more
