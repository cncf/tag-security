# [Project Name] TAG-Security Security Assessment Post-Survey

This survey is designed to gather feedback from project members and security
reviewers to determine the effectiveness, quality, and overall success of the
TSSA Process.  It may be used by projects during the
self-assessment or joint assessment and should be completed at the end.

## Value

1. *Did the project team find the TSSA Process valuable to the
   security stature of the project?*


2. *Did the reviewers find the TSSA Process valuable for
   establishing and evaluating the current security health of the project?*


3. *What was the most valuable artifact or portion of the process?*


## Quality

1. *Is the quality of the TSSA package / artifacts on par with previous
   TSSA packages (formerly assessments)?*


2. *For self-assessments, was the self-assessment content helpful for
   assisting in the security documentation of the project?*

## Efficiency

1. *Were there parts of the TSSA Process that could be improved,
   such as timeliness, communication, etc.?*


2. *Are portions of the artifacts produced from this assessment duplicate, or better left as references
   elsewhere?*

3. *For joint assessments, if a self-assessment was performed prior to the joint
   assessment, was the self-assessment beneficial for the creation of the joint
assessment?*

## Other

1.  *Would you recommend other projects receive a TSSA?*


2.  *What areas of the TSSA Process (templates, instructions,
    etc.) can be improved to make the experience and resulting artifacts more
useful or desirable?*


3.  *What additional feedback do you have?*
