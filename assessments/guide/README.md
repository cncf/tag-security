The SAFE WG has been ask to provide the CNCFâ€™s TOC with effective
information about the security of different projects.  The purpose of this
document is to outline the procedure by which a project should be audited
(by a set of members of the SAFE WG henceforth called SAFE examiners),
including the expected effort from different participants.  This procedure
can help the CNCF ensure that projects that are being considered for
inclusion in the CNCF have reasonable security fundamentals that are
expected to stop an attacker.  


Due to the nature and timeframe for the analysis, *this review is not meant
to subsume the need for a professional security audit of the code*.  Audits
of implementation vulnerabilities and similar issues at that level are not
intended to be covered by this audit.  The purpose of this effort is to 
uncover design flaws and to obtain a clear articulation of what the project's 
design goals and security properties are intended to be.
