# Security Reviewers

Reviewers will try to understand the
system and probe its security.  Specifically design level issues are meant
to be addressed as well as high level problems with the projectâ€™s setup and
operation. This is meant to provide an independent analysis and estimation
of the above information.  The goal is to ask questions to understand if
there are hidden assumptions, underestimated risk, or design issues that
harm the security of the project.  It may be useful to reach out to
community members to understand the answers to some questions, especially
involving deployment scenarios and the impact of attacks.

## Qualifications

### Required

Unless approved by the SIG chairs, at least one of the reviewers will
have previously performed a CNCF project security assessment.
Exemptions to this are reviewed case by case upon established need by the CNCF Security SIG Chairs and Co-Chairs in order to bootstrap the process as appropriate.

### Preferred

It is preferred reviewers have previous experience performing security audits or assessments for a variety of
organizations.  An ideal reviewer should also have been the recipient
of CNCF project security assessments for a software project they manage.  

Note: it is encouraged to have participation (shadowing) from participants that are not
yet qualified in order to provide and assist in gaining necessary skills to be a reviewer
in the future.

## Time and effort

The level of effort for the reviewers is expected to be 10 hours over the course of a few weeks.
Correspondance, project availability, and clarification of a project's scope or other details in the ticketed request for project security assessment may add additional time.  Effort is expected to include and may not be limited to:
* reviewing existing security documentation
* reviewing ticketed request for project security assessment
* analysis of security assertions and assumptions
