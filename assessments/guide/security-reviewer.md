## SAFE examiner qualifications

Unless approved by the SAFE WG chairs, at least one of the examiners will
have previously performed a SAFE WG audit.  (Exemptions are expected to be
granted bootstrap the process but only in extreme cases later on.)  In
general, a SAFE examiner should have performed security audits for diverse
organizations.  The ideal SAFE examiner should also have been the recipient
of security audits for a software project they manage.  Note that it is
encouraged to have participation (shadowing) from participants that are not
yet qualified to help them gain the necessary skills to be a SAFE examiner
in the future.
