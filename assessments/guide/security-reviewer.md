# Security Reviewer Role

Reviewers seek to understand the system and probe its security.
Design level issues should be considered as well as any high
level problems with the projectâ€™s setup and operation. The [process](./)
is intended to provide an independent analysis based primarily on documents
provided by the project itself.

Reviewers may look at code, but aren't required to do so. Review of
documents includes asking questions to understand if there are hidden
assumptions, underestimated risk, or design issues that harm or risk
the security of the project.

Reviewers are encouraged to reach out to community members to resolve
some questions, especially involving deployment scenarios and the impact
of attacks.

## Qualifications

### Required 

Unless approved by the SIG chairs, at least one of the reviewers will have previously performed a CNCF security assessment.  Exemptions to this are reviewed case by case upon established need by the CNCF Security SIG Chairs in order to bootstrap the process as appropriate.

### Preferred

Note: it is encouraged to have participation (shadowing) from participants that are not yet qualified in order to provide and assist in gaining necessary skills to be a reviewer in the future.

## Time and effort

The level of effort for the reviewers is expected to be 10 hours per review. Correspondance, project availability, and clarification of a project's scope or other details in the ticketed request for project security assessment may require additional time, however analsis is expected to be concluded in a few weeks.  Effort is expected to include and may not be limited to:
* reviewing existing security documentation
* reviewing ticketed request for project security assessment
* analysis of security assertions and assumptions
* attending project presentation with Q&A
* discussion via Slack or additional live Q&A sessions

## Expectations
