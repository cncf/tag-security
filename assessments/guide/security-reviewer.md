# Security Reviewers

Reviewers will try to understand the
system and probe its security.  Specifically design level issues are meant
to be addressed as well as high level problems with the projectâ€™s setup and
operation. This is meant to provide an independent analysis and estimation
of the above information.  The goal is to ask questions to understand if
there are hidden assumptions, underestimated risk, or design issues that
harm the security of the project.  It may be useful to reach out to
community members to understand the answers to some questions, especially
involving deployment scenarios and the impact of attacks.

## Qualifications

Unless approved by the SIG chairs, at least one of the reviewers will
have previously performed a SAFE WG audit.  (Exemptions are expected to be
granted bootstrap the process but only in extreme cases later on.)  In
general, a reviewer should have performed security audits for diverse
organizations.  The ideal reviewer should also have been the recipient
of security audits for a software project they manage.  Note that it is
encouraged to have participation (shadowing) from participants that are not
yet qualified to help them gain the necessary skills to be a reviewer
in the future.

## Time and effort

The level of effort for the reviewers is expected to be 10 hours.
Despite the fact that there may be some back and forth to get clarification
on a few points, it is expected analysis can usually be concluded in a few
weeks.  This will primarily involve carefully reading the written
document and analyzing the security assertions and assumptions.
