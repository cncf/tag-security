# Security Reviewer Role

     Reviewers will try to understand the system and probe its security.  Specifically design level issues are meant to be addressed as well as high level problems with the project’s setup and operation. This is meant to provide an independent analysis and estimation of the above information.  The goal is to ask questions to understand if there are hidden assumptions, underestimated risk, or design issues that harm the security of the project.  It may be useful to reach out to community members to understand the answers to some questions, especially involving deployment scenarios and the impact of attacks.

## Qualifications

### Required 

     Unless approved by the SIG chairs, at least one of the reviewers will have previously performed a CNCF project security assessment.  Exemptions to this are reviewed case by case upon established need by the CNCF Security SIG Chairs in order to bootstrap the process as appropriate.

### Preferred

     It is preferred reviewers have previous experience performing formal or informal software or security audits or assessments for a variety of organizations.  An ideal reviewer should also have been the recipient of CNCF project security assessments for a software project they manage.  

     Note: it is encouraged to have participation (shadowing) from participants that are not yet qualified in order to provide and assist in gaining necessary skills to be a reviewer in the future.

## Time and effort

     The level of effort for the reviewers is expected to be 10 hours per review. Correspondance, project availability, and clarification of a project's scope or other details in the ticketed request for project security assessment may require additional time, however analsis is expected to be concluded in a few weeks.  Effort is expected to include and may not be limited to:
* reviewing existing security documentation
* reviewing ticketed request for project security assessment
* analysis of security assertions and assumptions
* attending project presentation with Q&A
* discussion via Slack or additional live Q&A sessions

## Expectations

     GitHub issues are assigned to Security Reviewers. Security Reviewers are 
expected to conduct an in-depth review described in the [Security Assessment
Guide](./). Security Reviewers should seek the approval of the other 
participating Security Reviewers and at least 1 co-chair before merging.
