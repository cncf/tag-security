# Project lead

In the context of the project security review and self-assessment, the
"project lead" should be someone on the security team for the project.  For new
or smaller projects without an established security team, this could be a
project maintainer or they may delegate to a regular contributor with an
interest in security.

## Time and effort

The level of effort for the team providing the information is expected to be 
around **80 hours** of work.  Note, projects that have already performed a 
security analysis internally are expected to have much lower requirements.

## Conflict of interest

A project lead should not have any [conflict of interest](./security-reviewer.md#conflict-of-interest) with the project.
