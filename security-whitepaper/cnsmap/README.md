# Cloud Native Security Map

## About the Cloud Native Security Map

The Cloud Native Security Map(cnsmap) is a interactive medium for the
consumption of the security whitepaper. In addition to the content of the
whitepaper, the cloud native security map also provides additional practitioner
context and lists of cloud native projects.

The cnsmap mirror is hosted at: <https://cnsmap.vercel.app/>

### Goals and Non-goals

Goals

- Provide a mapping of CNCF and open source projects to areas of CN Security
  whitepaper
- Provide a practical viewpoint and information on topics in the CN Security
  whitepaper
- Identify gaps in CN Security in the ecosystem and make recommendations to TOC
- Help educate practitioners of what technologies can be used in practice and
  how they tie into each other
- Provide practical tips or examples for how to use tools within this category,
  or why they are important (i.e. example breaches, etc.)
- Provide a reference for frameworks to utilize when developing CN Security
  solutions and architectures.

Non-goals:

- Not an implementation guide on how to implement CN Security
- Demonstrative, not procedural
- Not a checklist of what to do
- Not one technology focused (i.e. not taking 1 reference architecture and
  developing the landscape around it).

## Logistics

### Code and content

The Cloud Native Security Map content and code is located in the [cnsmap
branch](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/tree/cnsmap). All content is
maintained within the [content
subfolder](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/tree/cnsmap/content).

### Community

### Hosting

The current mirror is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). However, because
of organizational restrictions on Vercel accounts, the code is currently hosted
from [lumjjb/cnsmap](https://github.com/lumjjb/cnsmap) which tracks the upstream
branch with eventual consistency.
