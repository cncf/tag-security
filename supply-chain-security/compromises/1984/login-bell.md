# Unix Support Group Event

According to [secondary sources research](https://niconiconi.neocities.org/posts/ken-thompson-really-did-launch-his-trusting-trust-trojan-attack-in-real-life/), a [well-known, published author](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358198.358210) deployed a compiler trojan attack on the Unix login command by advertising a non-backwards-compatible feature to Bell Labs' Unix Support Group, making its way to the login command within a month.

## Impact

None as reported.

## Type of compromise

Compiler backdoor, possibly compounded with human elements.

Note: it's likely this event occured in the 70s but, absent primary sources, we picked the year _Reflections_ was published.
