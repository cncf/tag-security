# Security issue on ROS build farm

The machine hosting the ROS 1 build farm was compromised (possibly via a vuln in the Jenkins Groovy plugin), with sufficient privilege escalation to access the GPG keys for signing packages in the ROS repository. Keys were rotated and a full rebuild was triggered.

## Impact

* "we are unlikely to ever be able to completely rule out malicious interference in the ROS binary packaging pipeline"
* Unsupported ROS distros that previously had binary packages were moved to a different repo with unique keys
* Users needed to rotate public keys manually on the client side
* Downstream users needed to update their Dockerfiles and Travis/GitLab CI files

## Type of compromise

Attack Chaining via Trust & Signing, Publishing Infrastructure and Dev Tooling - Build farm compromise with access to private keys used for repo
