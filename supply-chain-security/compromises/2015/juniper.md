# Juniper Incident

The Juniper attack was done by inserting malicious code in the operating system
of Juniper NetScreen VPN routers. This unauthorized code enabled remote
administrative access, and allowed passive decryption of VPN traffic. The first
vulnerability was done by implanting back door in the SSH password checker and
the second one happened by compromising a pseudorandom number generator.

## Impact

N/A

## Type of compromise

It appears attackers had access to a the source code hosting infrastructure,
but not to developer keys.
