# NotPetya 

NotPetya compromised the software infrastructure to tamper the patch code. It
infected the update server of an Ukrainian accounting software called MeDoc. As
a result, the attackers could inject a backdoor into the MeDoc application
which allowed the delivery of a ransomware and stealing credentials. Having
control over the update server, the attackers were able to update the infected
machines with a new malicious version. 

Note that it seems unlikely that the attackers could plant such stealthy
backdoor without having access to MeDocâ€™s source code. 

## Impact

N/A

## Type of compromise

The attackers seem to have been able to compromise software publishing
infrastructure, update servers and probably the version control system for
MeDoc, as well as signing keys for updates.
