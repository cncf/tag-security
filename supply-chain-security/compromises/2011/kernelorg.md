# kernel.org infrastructure compromise

While the kernel.org compromise didn't likely involve source code (and would have had limited impact), from gkh's mail: "the compromise of kernel.org and related machines has made it clear that some developers, at least, have had their systems penetrated."

## Impact

Clean installs were recommended, checking package signatures, logs, etc., for all kernel developers and then rotating PGP keys.

## Type of compromise

Dev Tooling & Publishing Infrastructure.
