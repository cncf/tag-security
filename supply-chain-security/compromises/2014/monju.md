# Monju Incident

The attackers subverted the distribution server of GOM Player software and
delivered a malicious version of the software to users. Upon connecting to the
application website to update the installed software, users were redirected to a
different website, controlled by the attackers. As a result, the users received
a modified version of the software bundled with a Trojan.

## Impact

The attack affected machines at Monju fast breeder reactor facility in Japan.
However, it it unclear whether other machines who tried to upate their GOM
Player software were infected.

## Type of compromise

Attackers could have access to the publishing infrastructure, but did not sign
the delivered product.
