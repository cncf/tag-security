# Keydnap

The download server of the torrent client Transmission was hacked and a
malicious version of the client was uploaded. The malicious copy of the software
was signed using a legitimate certificate (which appears to be stolen from the
Apple developer program).

## Impact

N/A

## Type of compromise

The publishing infrastructure was affected, plus a developer certificate (by
someone not associated with Transmission) was used to sign and allow for a
legitimate-looking installation
