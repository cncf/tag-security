# Auth0 Code Repository Stolen

Auth0, part of Okta, revealed that its source repository archives from 2020 and
before were stolen.

## Impact

A "third-party individual" informed Okta that they possessed Auth0 source code
from 2020 and earlier. An investigation was unable to find unauthorized access
to Okta environments.

## Type of Compromise

It's not entirely clear what the type of compromise is here. It appears to be
source code like the [Intel BIOS
leak](/supply-chain-security/compromises/2022/intel-alder-lake-BIOS-leak.md) and
might also involve dev tooling depending on how the attacker gained access to
the source code.
