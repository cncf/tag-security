# npm Libraries ‘colors’ and ‘faker’ Sabotaged in Protest by their Maintainer

The author of these `npm` libraries intentionally committed corrupt versions
containing infinite loops, effectively causing a denial of service.

## Impact

This incident affected a large but unknown number of users and impacting large
downstream projects such as aws-cdk, Jest and Node.js Open CLI Framework.

It triggered another wave of conversations around pinning (locking) dependencies
for future-proofing.

A few weeks after this incident, it was announced that the
[Top-100 npm package maintainers now require 2FA](https://github.blog/2022-02-01-top-100-npm-package-maintainers-require-2fa-additional-security/).

## Type of Compromise

This incident fits the [malicious maintainer](../compromise-definitions.md#malicious-maintainer)
definition.
