# Compromised Comm100 Live Chat Application Infects Customers

"A trojanized Comm100 Live Chat installer signed with a valid Comm100 Network Corporation certificate on September 26 was distributed from the companyâ€™s website from at least September 27 until September 29, 2022. The vendor claims to have more than 15,000 customers across 51 countries."

## Impact

According to CrowdStrike "The trojanized file was identified at organizations in the industrial, healthcare, technology, manufacturing, insurance and telecommunications sectors in North America and Europe"

"The Comm100 installer is an Electron application in which the attackers injected a JavaScript backdoor, within the main.js file of the embedded archive. When executed, the backdoor fetches and runs a second-stage script from an external resource" that "provides the attackers with remote shell functionality."

An updated Comm100 installer has been released.
