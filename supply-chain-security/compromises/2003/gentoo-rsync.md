# Gentoo Incident

Attackers used a remote exploit to compromise an rsync.gentoo.org machine
holding a copy of the emerge repository and implant a rootkit 

## Impact

N/A

## Type of compromise

The attackers were able to compromise filesystem of the source code repository
and thus possibly (but highly unlikely) serve malicious packages to users.
