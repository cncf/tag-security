Software Supply Chain 
=====================

Supply chain compromises are a powerful attack vector. In cloud native
deployments everything is software-defined, so there is increased risk when
there are vulnerabilities in this area. If an attacker controls the supply
chain, they can potentially reconfigure anything in an insecure way.

# What are supply chain vulnerabilities and their implications?

The [Catalog of Supply Chain Compromises](./compromises) provides real-world 
examples that help raise awareness and provide detailed information that 
let's us understand attack vectors and consider how to mitigate potential
risk.

# On mitigating vulnerabilities

There is on-going work to establish best practices in this area.
