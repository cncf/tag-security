Software Supply Chain Security Paper
==========================================

# About

The Software Supply Chain Security Paper is a STAG effort 
to ensure the cloud native community has access to information about building, 
distributing, deploying, and running secure software supply chains.

## Updates to the paper 

The Software Supply Chain Security Paper (SSCSP) is intended to be a living 
document created and maintained for the community, by its members.  

Updates to the paper, suggestions for updates, or discussion for updates
should initiate with an [issue](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/issues) submitted to the repo and labeled with
"suggestion" and "supplychain".

### Markdown 

The living SSCSP is maintained in [markdown](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/blob/master/supply-chain-security/software-supply-chain-security-whitepaper.md) and all updates will be made in
 markdown.  

### Contributing updates 

All members of the community are welcome to contribute updates to the SSCSP.
We ask potential contributors to refer to the original design decisions, 
listed below, as guidance when determining the content of their updates.

It is highly recommended that you seek peer review for your updates beyond that
of the Technical Leads and Co-Chairs of the STAG.

Once the PR is submitted, please place the link in the CNCF SIG-Security Channel
for the SSCSP: [#sig-security-supply-chain-wg](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01KL0B4LKC) to request a review.

### Versioning and publishing 

It is expected that many minor updates will occur, corrections to grammar, 
spelling, clarification in language, translations, etc.  When these occur 
they are considered minor changes to the overall content and will not warrant
 the regeneration of the PDF.

When significant changes to the intent, content, or numerous minor changes
occur, the SSCSP working group will assess and determine if a new major version
of the PDF needs published.  When this decision is made, the markdown content
will be converted to text document and sent to the CNCF technical writers to
create the PDF.  The PDF will then be published back into the repository
annotating the new version, updating the links in the README.md accordingly.

Minor updates to the markdown shall receive a minor version bump indicated in the
Metadata table of the document and recorded as WIP.  When enough significant
changes have been recorded, the markdown will be placed "In Review" (via PR) and
solicited to the CNCF STAG and TOC mailing list for review, at a minimum.

Upon completion of review, the STAG TOC Liaison shall provide final
approval on the PR.  At which point the markdown state will be changed to
"Approved" and merged.
