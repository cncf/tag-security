Prior to now, TAG Security has kept a list of time-based events and associated links. The tracking was previously maintained by several attentive TAG members, and served as a good way to keep folks aware and involved.

As part of the website redesign and the reorganization of the main TAG git repo, we've decided not to store a centralized list of non-recurring events.

But we realized that there were some gems in there that were too good to lose! Below is a list of presentations that you can view to learn more about the history of our community and its contributors.

We may find a tidy place to track this in the future, but for now the blog is a safe place to make this list available.

Enjoy!
