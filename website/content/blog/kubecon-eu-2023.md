At Kubecon EU next month TAG App Delivery will bring together cloud-native
application developers and framework builders to meet each other and share
insights and knowledge. Our goal is to make cloud development better for all by
gathering feedback, finding synergies and guiding both users and projects.

To this end the TAG will host a [pre-day meetup](https://kccnceu2023.sched.com/event/1JWPr/tag-app-delivery-project-meeting)
on Tuesday April 18 at 1pm and meetups on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons in
our booth in the Projects Pavilion.

We invite maintainers and users to share innovations and insights with fellow
experts by presenting 7-minute talks at any of these meetups. Please let us know
that you'd like to present by filling out [this simple proposal form](https://forms.gle/MpgyCcGpygr8zQC66).
