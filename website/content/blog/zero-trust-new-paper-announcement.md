What comes to mind when you think of Zero Trust security? Personally, I had a distorted understanding of this concept
until now, seeing it as an approach that blindly assumed that security, once granted, was eternal or... at least valid
until the next release. It roughly presumed that access policy wouldn't be violated, the network perimeter wouldn't be
breached, and a vulnerable pod wouldn't be exploited. Up until nowâ€¦

After reading the Zero Trust paper by the CNCF security team, my understanding of this philosophy has radically changed,
and my previous view shifted into something I'd call "Limited Trust." For some, the CNCF paper introduces, and for
others reminds, of a notion of total lack of confidence, regardless of the request's source. It enforces
a "trust nothing" policy, relying on metrics that are constantly evaluated and adjusted according to the current context.
Stolen credentials of a benign user or an exploited Kubernetes instance will no longer be a foothold for significant damage,
as non-standard activity is expected to be quickly identified and neutralised. This is the key takeaway from the document.

To learn how to actually implement this, immerse yourself in the reading.
