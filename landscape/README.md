## Goal

We propose the creation of a separate security-focused landscape (similar to the separate, Serverless-focused landscape)
that uses major categories that are similar to those used in the primary CNCF Landscape, but with sub-categories that
highlight the main security considerations in each category.

In this document we propose the draft structure of the “Security Landscape”. At this stage we are _only_ proposing
the structure of the Security Landscape and are not attempting to fill it in with tools from the existing CNCF Landscape.
We drafted this document after reviewing the current list of projects in the CNCF Landscape and recommendations by SANS and
Gartner for good security practices, as well as drawing on our own experience. In future work, we will work with the
community to determine how best to map cloud-native tools into the sub-categories of the "Security Landscape" we propose below.

A note on how the work of mapping tools into the sub-categories may proceed: we do not currently have plans for precisely
how projects will be mapped into the Security Landscape. If we were to follow the model of the current CNCF landscape we
would require each project to be placed in exactly one security landscape sub-category, but this forces tools with multiple
common uses to artificially choose a “most common” use case as its sub-category. A possible alternative will be to define a
list of key features, map the key features into the landscape sub-categories, and then list the key features of each tool.
In this flow, individual tools may appear in multiple sub-categories. Deciding precisely how to map tools into the security
landscape sub-categories is future work and will occur after gathering feedback from the community on the preferred solution.
