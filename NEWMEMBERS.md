## New Members

The purpose of this plan is to ensure that you become familiar with the team and know how you will contribute. The first step is to get yourself familiar with our mission at [SIG-Security charter](governance/charter.md).

New members are advised to:

* Join the [CNCF Slack team](https://slack.cncf.io/), particulary [#tag-security](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CDJ7MLT8S) channel and introduce yourself.
* Initially go through the following documents in the repository:
	* [README.md](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/README.md) 
	* [CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
	* [Usecases](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/tree/main/usecase-personas)
* Regularly join the [Zoom meeting](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/README.md#meeting-time) at least for the first couple of months to get yourself up to speed. 
* Here are multiple ways to get involved:
	* Join the meeting as advised above and express your area of interests or if you want to work on any specific issue.
	* Express your thoughts or ask questions on an issue you find interesting.
	* Choose an issue where [help is needed](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/labels/help%20wanted) and comment on it expressing interest.
