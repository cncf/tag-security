# Automated Governance

The CNCF TAG Security group has made significant strides in guiding the community towards secure software practices with the Secure Software Factory Reference Architecture Paper. Building on this foundation, this initiative aims to provide comprehensive guidelines and best practices for implementing automated governance processes within cloud native environments. It will focus on integrating security, compliance, and auditability into CI/CD pipelines, offering a clear pathway to automate and operationalize governance and compliance engineering practices.

## Goals

- Provide guidelines and best practices for implementing automated governance processes in cloud native environments.
- Integrate security, compliance, and auditability into CI/CD pipelines.
- Streamline compliance processes and enhance the overall security posture of cloud native applications.

## Scope

The scope of this project includes:
- Research and analysis of current automated governance practices.
- Development of a comprehensive reference architecture.
- Creation of best practice guidelines and documentation.
- Potential development of tooling or integration patterns for common CI/CD platforms.
