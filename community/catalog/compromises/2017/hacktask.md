# HackTask

HackTask  used typosquatting to register packages that had names similar to
popular libraries on the npm registry. As a result, the attacker could steal
developer credentials.

## Impact

38 typosquatted JS packages were found on the npm repositories. These packages
were downloaded at least 700 times during the two week period that the
compromise spanned.

## Type of compromise

A typosquat attack does not require compromising any type of infrastructure.
