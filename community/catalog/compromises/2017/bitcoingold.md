# Bitcoin Gold

A backdoored version of Bitcoin wallet was planted by the attackers who gained
access to the GitHub repository. As a result, those users who downloaded the
infected version instead of the official one might have lost their private keys
if they created new wallets using this malicious software.

## Impact

Users who downloaded the compromised wallet during a window of 4.5 days may
have their private keys compromises.

## Type of compromise

The attackers seem to have been able to access the version control system but
not to sign on behalf of developers.
