# Code Space Incident

Code Spaces, a cloud base service offering project management and code repositories, 
was hacked and many repositories, backups, etc. were deleted by the attacker.

## Impact

N/A

## Type of compromise

It appears attackers had access to the source code hosting infrastructure,
but not to developer keys.
