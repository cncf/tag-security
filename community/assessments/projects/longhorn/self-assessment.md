## Overview
Longhorn is a cloud-native, distributed block storage system for Kubernetes. It provides highly available and resilient storage, supporting operations like snapshotting, backup, and disaster recovery.


### Background
Longhorn is a cloud-native distributed block storage system designed to run on Kubernetes. It is particularly engineered to provide persistent storage for stateful applications running in Kubernetes clusters. In cloud-native architectures, persistence, resilience, and scalability are critical challenges due to the ephemeral nature of containerised workloads. Longhorn addresses these challenges by turning distributed block storage into a micro-service, managed by Kubernetes, making it highly available and resilient.

* `Pods and Volumes`: Longhorn integrates with Kubernetes through volumes presented to pods. These volumes are dynamically provisioned by Longhorn as per the demands of the pods, which could be running various workloads such as databases, CMS, or any stateful application.
* `Longhorn Engine`: Each volume is managed by a dedicated Longhorn Engine, which is responsible for replicating and synchronising data across multiple nodes in the cluster. This dedicated engine approach ensures that the failure of one volume does not impact the function of others.
* `Replicas`: The data for each volume is replicated across multiple replicas spread over different nodes, as shown in the image. This design enhances data protection and availability. If one node fails, the data is still accessible from other replicas.
* `Nodes and Disks`: Longhorn is designed to work with the underlying infrastructure such as in SSDs. As depicted, Longhorn can manage multiple disks across nodes, optimising the utilisation of available storage resources within the cluster.
* `Data Flow`: The image illustrates how read and write operations are conducted across the system. Data written to a Kubernetes volume is managed by the Longhorn Engine and then replicated to the replicas. These replicas handle the actual storage of data on the physical disks. This multi-layered approach allows for a flexible and resilient system that can withstand various failure scenarios.

Longhorn's placement within the cloud-native ecosystem is characterised by its focus on simplicity, reliability, and ease of use. It provides a user-friendly interface, automated volume and snapshot management, backup and restore capabilities, and disaster recovery solutions, all of which are crucial for managing stateful applications in a Kubernetes environment.


### Actors
* `Longhorn Manager`: Manages API calls, volume creation, and overall orchestration within Kubernetes. It communicates with the Kubernetes API server and orchestrates the Longhorn Engine and replicas.
* `Longhorn Engine`: A storage controller responsible for synchronously replicating volumes across multiple nodes. It runs on the same node as the pod using the Longhorn volume, thereby isolating the replication process to specific nodes and limiting lateral movement in case of a compromise.
* `Users/Administrators`: Interact with Longhorn through Kubernetes or the Longhorn UI. This actor is distinct in terms of access control and permissions, which are essential for maintaining the security and integrity of the system.


### Actions
* `Volume Provisioning and Attachment`:
    * Security Checks: Authenticate and authorise Kubernetes volume requests through the Kubernetes RBAC system before provisioning.
    * Data Handling: Provisioning of a volume is done with consideration to data placement policies and storage resource availability on the nodes.
    * Actor Interactions: The Longhorn Manager communicates with Kubernetes to create a Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and attaches the volume to the appropriate Pod through the Longhorn Engine.
* `Data Replication`:
    * Security Checks: Replication actions are triggered by the Longhorn Engine after ensuring the volume is in a healthy state and authorised for replication.
    * Data Handling: Data is written to the primary volume and then replicated across multiple replicas to ensure redundancy. The integrity of data during replication is maintained by checksum verification.
    * Actor Interactions: The Longhorn Engine orchestrates the replication process across different replicas residing on SSDs in various nodes, ensuring data consistency and handling any replication failures.
* `Snapshot and Backup Operations`:
    * Security Checks: Verify that the request for snapshots or backups comes from an authenticated and authorised source.
    * Data Handling: Snapshots are taken at a consistent state of the volume, and backups are securely transmitted to and from integrated external backup services like NFS or AWS S3, with encryption where applicable.
    * Actor Interactions: Longhorn interacts with the external backup services to store and manage backups, providing an additional layer of data protection and recovery options.
* `Volume Restoration and Recovery`:
    * Security Checks: Validate the authenticity and integrity of backup data before initiating a volume restoration.
    * Data Handling: Restores volume data from snapshots or backups accurately, ensuring no data corruption occurs during the process.
    * Actor Interactions: The Longhorn system manages the recovery process, coordinating between the backup services and the Kubernetes cluster to restore data to the respective Pods and volumes efficiently.


### Goals
* Data Security and Integrity: Ensuring that data stored and managed by Longhorn is protected from unauthorised access and corruption. This includes securing data at rest (via encryption if configured) and in transit across the network.
* Resilience and Availability: Longhorn is designed to maintain high availability and data durability across Kubernetes clusters. This involves replicating data across multiple nodes and ensuring that the failure of a single component does not lead to data loss.
* Secure Data Operations: Providing secure mechanisms for creating, managing, and restoring volumes, with robust authentication and authorisation checks to ensure that only authorised users and systems can perform these operations.
* Disaster Recovery: Offering secure and reliable disaster recovery solutions, enabling quick and consistent data recovery in case of catastrophic events, thereby safeguarding against data loss.
* Compliance with Kubernetes Security Standards: Ensuring that Longhorn's architecture and operations adhere to Kubernetes security best practices, including integration with Kubernetes' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing access to its resources.


### Non-goals
* Primary Database Services: Longhorn is not intended to serve as a primary database or a data processing system. It is a block storage system for Kubernetes and does not handle database management functions.
* Data Analytics and Processing: Longhorn is not designed for direct involvement in data analytics or processing tasks. Its role is confined to the storage and retrieval of data for such operations, not processing or analysing the data itself.
* Limitless Data Storage: While Longhorn facilitates data storage, it is not designed to support unlimited data storage or handle scenarios where the volume of data could potentially overwhelm the storage capacity or incur excessive costs.
* Network Infrastructure Management: Longhorn's scope does not include the management or configuration of underlying network infrastructure. It focuses on the storage aspect within the given network environment.
* Comprehensive Data Security: While Longhorn implements measures to secure data, it does not offer a complete data security solution. Users are responsible for implementing additional security measures according to their specific requirements, such as network security or end-to-end encryption of sensitive data.


## Self-assessment use

This self-assessment is not intended to provide a security audit of Longhorn, or function as an independent assessment or attestation of Longhorn's security health.

This document serves to provide Longhorn users with an initial understanding of Longhorn's security, where to find existing security documentation, Longhorn plans for security, and general overview of Longhorn security practices, both for development of Longhorn as well as security of Longhorn.

This document provides the CNCF TAG-Security with an initial understanding of Longhorn to assist in a joint-assessment, necessary for projects under incubation. Taken together, this document and the joint-assessment serve as a cornerstone for if and when Longhorn seeks graduation and is preparing for a security audit.

## Security functions and features

Critical Security Components:
* Volume Encryption: Ensures that data at rest is encrypted, providing confidentiality and protection against unauthorised access. This is a non-configurable element critical for data security, especially when handling sensitive information.
* Data Replication Integrity: Synchronous replication of data across multiple replicas in different nodes ensures high availability and integrity of data. This is vital for maintaining the state of the data in case of node failure.
* Automated Snapshot Management: Regular, automatic snapshots protect against data loss by preserving the state of data at specific points in time. These snapshots form the basis for recovery in the event of corruption or data loss incidents.

Security-Relevant Components:
* Configurable Replication and Backup Settings: While the replication process itself is critical, the ability to configure the number of replicas and backup intervals allows administrators to tailor the redundancy and backup frequency to the risk profile of the data being stored.
* Kubernetes' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Integration: By leveraging Kubernetes RBAC, Longhorn ensures that only authorised users and processes can manage volumes, snapshots, and backups, thus enforcing the principle of least privilege.
* Health Checks and Monitoring: Longhorn's continuous health checks and monitoring of volumes and replicas are crucial for early detection of potential issues, allowing for proactive remediation before they escalate into security incidents.
* Backup Data Validation: Before restoring data from backups, Longhorn validates the backup integrity, ensuring that the data has not been tampered with or corrupted, which is essential for the reliability of the restoration process.


## Project compliance
* Compliance: Longhorn adheres to best practices for Kubernetes storage solutions, ensuring it aligns with the security and operational standards expected within the cloud-native ecosystem. However, specific compliance certifications or adherence to standards like PCI-DSS, COBIT, ISO, or GDPR have not been documented.
