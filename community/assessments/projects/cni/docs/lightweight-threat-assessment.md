# CNI Lightweight Threat Assessment

## Introduction

This document presents a lightweight threat assessment for the Container Network Interface (CNI) project, aiming to identify potential security threats and propose mitigation strategies.

## Threat Analysis

### Potential Unauthorized Access to Network Configurations

* Category: Repudiation
* Given that CNI is an administrative tool used to manage container networking, malicious or abusive actions that CNI is directed to perform should be traceable.
* Possible Mitigation Strategies:
    * Mandate logging mechanisms.
    * Implement auditing of access logs.

### Misconfiguration of Networks Leading to Vulnerabilities

* Category: Denial of Service, Tampering
* Certain configurations may lead to unexpected denial of service or tampering due to a plugin's precedence rules or if a configuration is invalid.
* Possible Mitigation Strategies:
    * Provide clear documentation on secure configuration practices.
    * Implement configuration validation tools.

## Conclusion

Ongoing evaluation and updates to this assessment are necessary to adapt to evolving security threats in the CNI project.
