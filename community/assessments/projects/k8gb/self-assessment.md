### Intended use

To increase the software supply chain security, we encourage our users to consume k8gb container images with Kyverno's admission webhook
([/policy](https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/verify-images/sigstore/#verifying-image-signatures)) that will ensure that
images are signed and nobody had tempered with them. Our public key that can be used to verify this is in the root or our repository.

## Overview

k8gb is implemented using the Kubernetes operator pattern with a single CRD (Custom Resource Definition) to enable Global Load Balancing. k8gb provides independent GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing) capability to any Ingress or Service without a dedicated management cluster, instead relying on timeproof DNS (Domain Name System). k8gb has no single point of failure, and uses Kubernetes native application health checks (such as liveness and readiness probes) to update DNS records to aid in load balancing decisions.

### Background

Global enterprises moving to the cloud need a global load balancer to make intelligent routing decisions based on the health and availability of Kubernetes services across multiple clusters and geographic regions. Traditional proprietary software and vendor solutions exist, but these are often expensive, complex, and not cloud native. Many require dedicated hardware appliances and operate outside the Kubernetes ecosystem, creating operational overhead and vendor lock-in.

k8gb addresses these challenges as a vendor-neutral, CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) Sandbox project. It is designed as a cloud-native Kubernetes Global Load Balancer that operates entirely within the Kubernetes ecosystem. Unlike traditional solutions, k8gb does not require any special software, dedicated hardware, or external management systems - it relies exclusively on open source software (OSS) and CNCF projects, integrating seamlessly with existing Kubernetes workflows such as GitOps, Kustomize, and Helm package management.

### Actors

The individual parts of k8gb that interact to provide the desired functionality.

- CoreDNS
  - Role: Embedded [custom CoreDNS](https://github.com/k8gb-io/coredns-crd-plugin) to serve DNS (Domain Name System) requests.
  - Isolation: runs as its own Pod
- ExternalDNS
  - Role: Integrated ExternalDNS to automate zone delegation configuration.  
  - Isolation: runs as its own Pod
- k8gb Controller
  - Role: Coordinates logic according to the GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing) strategy.
  - Isolation: runs as its own Pod

### Actions

The steps that k8gb performs in order to provide the desired functionality. See https://www.k8gb.io/docs/images/k8gb-components.svg. 

- CoreDNS
  - Functionality:
    - Serves external DNS requests with dynamically constructed DNS responses.
- ExternalDNS
  - Functionality:
    - Reads data from DNSEndpoint CR to update an external DNS provider (e.g., Route53).
- k8gb Controller
  - Functionality:
    - Watches all namespaces for `Gslb` custom resources.
    - Creates DNSEndpoint CR (Custom Resource) populated with information from `Gslb` Ingress status (application FQDN - Fully Qualified Domain Name and active IP addresses, which are used for dynamic A record composition).
    - Creates DNSEndpoint to configure DNS (Domain Name System) zone delegation in an external DNS provider.

### Goals

The intended goals of k8gb, including the security guarantees it provides.

#### Secure and Verified Builds

Ensure all k8gb releases are signed and verified to guarantee authenticity and integrity, protecting users from tampered or malicious builds.

#### Minimal Attack Surface

k8gb is designed with a minimal attack surface by exposing only the necessary ports for GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing) operations. Specifically, only DNS ports (53/tcp and 53/udp) are exposed for DNS resolution services. This approach significantly reduces the attack surface compared to traditional load balancing solutions that typically require multiple ports for:
- Management interfaces (often HTTP/HTTPS on various ports)
- Health check endpoints
- Administrative APIs
- Monitoring and telemetry interfaces

By operating exclusively through DNS, k8gb eliminates these additional attack vectors while maintaining full functionality.

#### Secure Deployment Practices

k8gb implements comprehensive secure deployment practices through multiple layers:

**Secure Defaults**: All k8gb components are configured with security-first defaults, including:
- Minimal required permissions through restrictive RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) policies
- Non-root container execution with read-only root filesystems where possible
- Resource limits and security contexts to prevent privilege escalation

**Documentation and Guidance**: Extensive documentation provides users with:
- Security hardening guidelines for production deployments
- Best practices for credential management and secret handling
- Network security recommendations for multi-cluster deployments
- Integration patterns with security tools like Pod Security Standards and network policies

**Kubernetes-Native Security**: k8gb leverages Kubernetes built-in security mechanisms rather than implementing custom security layers, ensuring compatibility with existing security policies and reducing complexity.

These goals aim to make k8gb a reliable and secure solution for global load balancing while minimizing risks and ensuring trust in the project's artifacts.

See also [Intended use](#intended-use).

### Non-goals

The k8gb project is focused on providing global load balancing and failover capabilities for Kubernetes applications. However, there are certain security-related features and responsibilities that are intentionally out of scope. Below are the non-goals, along with explanations for why they are not within the project's scope:

#### Traffic Handling and TLS Termination:

k8gb does not pass application traffic through itself or handle TLS/HTTP connections directly. These responsibilities are offloaded to referenced networking resources, such as Kubernetes Ingress controllers or service meshes.

**Reason**: k8gb is designed to manage DNS-based global load balancing and failover, not to act as a proxy or gateway for application traffic.

#### Security of Referenced Networking Resources:

k8gb does not enforce or manage security configurations (e.g., TLS settings) for the networking resources it references, such as Ingress controllers.

**Reason**: Security configurations for these resources are the responsibility of the user or the specific networking solution being used.

## Self-assessment use

This self-assessment is created by the k8gb team to perform an internal analysis of the project's security. It is not intended to provide a security audit of k8gb, or function as an independent assessment or attestation of k8gb's security health.

This document serves to provide k8gb users with an initial understanding of k8gb's security, where to find existing security documentation, k8gb plans for security, and general overview of k8gb security practices, both for development of k8gb as well as security of k8gb.

This document provides the CNCF TAG Security and Compliance with an initial understanding of k8gb to assist in a joint-assessment, necessary for projects under incubation. Taken together, this document and the joint-assessment serve as a cornerstone for if and when k8gb seeks graduation and is preparing for a security audit.

## Security functions and features

| Component | Applicability | Description of Importance |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| DNS-Based Traffic Management| `Critical`| k8gb uses DNS for global load balancing and failover, ensuring that traffic is routed to healthy clusters without passing through k8gb itself. This design minimizes the attack surface compared to traditional proxy-based load balancers and reduces the risk of traffic interception or manipulation versus solutions that handle application traffic directly. |
| Minimal Port Exposure | `Critical` | k8gb exposes only essential ports (53/tcp and 53/udp) for DNS operations, significantly reducing the attack surface compared to traditional load balancers that require multiple ports for management interfaces, health checks, and traffic handling, thereby limiting potential entry points for attackers. |
| Integration with Kubernetes RBAC | `Critical` | k8gb relies on Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can configure or modify k8gb resources. |
| Kubernetes Secrets for Sensitive Data | `Security Relevant` | k8gb uses Kubernetes secrets to store sensitive information, such as credentials and certificates, ensuring that this data is encrypted at rest and accessible only to authorized components. |
| Secure Default Configurations | `Security Relevant` | k8gb provides secure default configurations to help users deploy the project in a way that aligns with Kubernetes security best practices, reducing the risk of misconfiguration compared to complex traditional load balancing solutions that often require extensive manual security hardening. |

- Related Projects / Vendors
  - Kubernetes Ingress Controllers:
    k8gb is often compared to Kubernetes Ingress controllers (e.g., NGINX Ingress, Traefik). While Ingress controllers handle traffic routing within a single cluster, k8gb focuses on global load balancing and failover across multiple clusters, making it complementary to Ingress solutions.
  - External DNS Providers:
    k8gb integrates with external DNS providers (e.g., Route 53, Cloudflare) to manage DNS-based traffic routing. Unlike standalone DNS solutions, k8gb provides Kubernetes-native automation for global load balancing and failover.
  - Service Meshes:
    Service meshes (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) provide advanced traffic management and security features within a cluster. k8gb, on the other hand, operates at the DNS level, enabling cross-cluster traffic management without requiring changes to application code.
