# Gentoo Incident

Attackers gained control of the Github Gentoo organization, 
removed access to Gentoo repositories from developers, 
and modified the content of repositories as well as pages.


## Impact

N/A

## Type of compromise

It seems that the attackers have been able to hack 
the source code repository but not developer keys.
