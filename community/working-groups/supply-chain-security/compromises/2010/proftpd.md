# ProFTPD hack

A source code repository server of an open-source project (ProFTPD) was hacked
by unknown attackers who planted a backdoor in the source code.

## Impact

N/A

## Type of compromise

Publishing Infrastructure - the attackers gained access to the server hosting
distribution artifacts and replaced them. No signing seems to have been employed
and it's unlikely a key compromise was involved.
