# PyPI Library `ctx` and PHP's `PHPass` compromised due to account takeover

The authors of these libraries had their associated GitHub account expired,

account takeover.

## Impact

This incident affected tens of thousands of installs of `ctx` through-out
the 3 weeks time window between May 1st and May 21st, as well as impacting
roughly 2.5 million downloads of `PHPass`, according to Packagist.org.
