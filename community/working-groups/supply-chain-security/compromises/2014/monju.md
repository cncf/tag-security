# Monju Incident

The attackers subverted the distribution server of GOM Player software 
and delivered a malicious version of the software to users. 
Upon connecting to the application website to update the installed software, 
users were redirected to a different website, controlled by the attackers.
As a result, the users received a modified version of the software bundled with a Trojan.

## Impact

The attack affected machines at Monju fast breeder reactor facility in Japan.
However, it it unclear whether other machines who tried 
to upate their GOM Player software were infected. 

## Type of compromise

Attackers could have access to the publishing infrastructure, 
but did not sign the delivered product.
