# GitHub Ruby on Rails Repository Hack

The GitHub repository for the Ruby on Rails was compromised by an ethical hacker
using a vulnerability in the GitHub API.

## Impact

The Rails repository had an unauthorized commit added to it. GitHub responded
rapidly by fixing the vulnerability and the Rails maintainers removed the
commit. GitHub also improved its responsible disclosure mechanisms to enable
security researchers to submit issues without resorting to actually exploiting
the vulnerability.

## Type of Compromise
