# SAFE Recap @ [Kubecon Europe 2018](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2018/)

SAFE had two sessions for introducing SAFE and  getting feedback from the community.

* [SAFE WG Intro](https://kccnceu18.sched.com/event/ENw3/safe-wg-intro-jeyappragash-j-j-padmeio-ray-colline-google-any-skill-level)
* [SAFE WG Deep Dive](https://kccnceu18.sched.com/event/ENw5/safe-wg-deep-dive-ray-colline-google-intermediate-skill-level)

We had a small but relevant group and hallway conversations were equally engaging and informative.

Excited to have [Liz Rice](https://github.com/lizrice) and [Justin Cormack](https://github.com/justincormack) join us.

Across the board, everyone I had conversation with, there was a natural acknowledgement that security is an end-end problem and understanding secure access and providing a safe end-end system for end-user is critical.

We are just getting started on this, incredibly excited to be part of this team and the effort!
