# Controls

## Overview

This controls catalogue is focused on mapping to existing frameworks and regulations (CSA, NIST, FedRamp, SOX, GDPR, etc.), conversion to machine-readable format (OSCAL, JSON, etc.), inclusion of tests to validate/verify (both process and technical tests as appropriate), and application to security reviews to improve consistency of CNCF Security TAG reviews. It should also address requirements for Auditors for Cloud Native Platforms.

## Impact

This initiative aims to help various stakeholders by providing a standardized set of controls mapped to relevant frameworks and regulations, enabling easier compliance and security assessments in cloud native environments.
