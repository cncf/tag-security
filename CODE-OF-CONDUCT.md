# Code of Conduct 

We follow the 
[CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) 

As part of our pledge to respect all people, in both live in-person and online
interactions, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
native language, operating system choice, current software stack or prior
experience. 

In keeping with this commitment, we offer the following guidelines:
   * Welcome newcomers at any stage of expertise. 
     * Everyone has something to contribute. 
     * Everyone deserves access to materials and community that will help them learn. 
     * As long as an individual can be respectful and not disruptive to other participants, they deserve to participate.
   * Provide open and free material.
   * Be kind and courteous.
     * Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, offering private
     constructive feedback when communication style bears improvement.
     * Leave space for quieter voices.
   * Consider who is not in the room. 
     * Invite participation from experts or user community representatives
     outside of the working group.
     * Participate in online forums to be inclusive of those who cannot 
     attend meetings.
   * Work performed within this group, either finalized or in draft, is to be used in accordance with the group [Mission and Charter](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/blob/master/governance/charter.md), the open source license, and to be used for the equal benefit of all members of the community.  Further information on use of work may be found in [Security Assessments: Outcome](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/tree/master/assessments#outcome)
