# Security TAG Technical Lead Proposal Process

Security Technical Leads operate as a team alongside the Co-Chairs. The Co-Chair
team seeks enhance the leadership capabilities of the existing co-chairs across
the key qualities of industry experience, hands-on cloud-native and security
experience, as well as administrative experience needed to assist in the
execution of the various projects and efforts that make the Security TAG so
successful.

## Caveats of Technical Leads

* The position of a technical lead does not guarantee future co-chairpersonship
* The position of a technical lead is not a paid position (co-chairs are also not paid positions)
* Technical leads [have responsibilities](roles.md) to the Security TAG, the
  leadership team, and the TOC
* Nominations by the community (with co-chair endorsement) or co-chairs still
  [requires TOC
  approval](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections)

## Process of nominations

Depending on the needs of the community, as determined by the Security TAG
leadership team, technical lead nominations may come in the form of "Nominees by
community", "Nominees by co-chairs", or both.

The Security TAG does not have a current limit on the amount of technical leads.

Final technical lead nominations will adhere to the [CNCF's TOC described
process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections).
