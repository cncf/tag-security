# Security TAG Technical Lead Proposal Process

Security Technical Leads operate as a team alongside the Co-Chairs. The Co-Chair
team seeks enhance the leadership capabilities of the existing co-chairs across
the key qualities of industry experience, hands-on cloud-native and security
experience, as well as administrative experience needed to assist in the
execution of the various projects and efforts that make the Security TAG so
successful.

## Caveats of Technical Leads

* The position of a technical lead does not guarantee future co-chair nomination
* The position of a technical lead is not a paid position (co-chairs are also
  not paid positions)
* Technical leads [have responsibilities](roles.md) to the Security TAG, the
  leadership team, and the TOC
* Nominations by the community (with co-chair endorsement) or co-chairs still
  [requires TOC
  approval](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections)

## Process of nominations

Depending on the needs of the community, as determined by the Security TAG
leadership team, technical lead nominations may come in the form of "Nominees by
community", "Nominees by co-chairs", or both.

The Security TAG does not have a current limit on the amount of technical leads.

Final technical lead nominations will adhere to the [CNCF's TOC described
process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections).

### Nominees by community

Community nominees should adhere to the technical lead nomination requirements
described below. Any individual who is a member of the Security TAG list or the
tag-security slack channel may nominate another individual.

The co-chairs reserve the right to endorse a nominee by the community based on:

* Gender diversity
* Company diversity
* Geo diversity
* Amount of nominations from different companies, people, regions for a single
  individual
* Existing body of work
* Justification provided during nomination

#### Community timeline

Community nominations will to run for at least 1 month with a maximum up to 2
months. Upon close of nominations a decision will be made by the co-chairs
within the next month in order conform to the TOC process.

#### Submitting a nomination

Nominations are to be submitted to [Security TAG Co-Chairs email
alias](mailto:cncf-tag-security-chairs@lists.cncf.io) with the details:

* Subject "Technical Lead nomination: $NAME-OF-NOMINEE"
* CC the nominee
* TL requirements with examples (described below)
* Justification

#### Endorsement of community nominees

Co-chairs are responsible for providing endorsement of a community nominee to
show concurrence and support.

If no nominees are submitted by the community either as a result of lack of
participation, lack of requirements, or from co-chair specific selection
(non-community nomination process), the co-chairs must endeavor to nominate an
individual(s) that meet as many of the requirements as exist.

### Nominees by co-chairs

Nominees by co-chairs adhere to the technical lead requirements described below.
Co-chairs are responsible for documenting statistic information of all nominee
types for endorsement and presentation to the TOC.

## Technical Lead nomination requirements

In order to verify nominees by the community or by co-chairs have experience
with the group and are actively contributing in a meaningful way, the following
requirements must be met in order for an individual to be nominated.

If a given nominee does not meet all the requirements, the co-chairs will still
review the nomination and justification to determine if enough intent and
commitment is present to move forward with an endorsement.
