# SIG-Security Charter (draft)

## Charter
The charter of the working group is to reduce risk that cloud native
applications expose end user data or allow other unintended access.
Distributed deployments across heterogeneous infrastructure are increasingly
common for cloud native applications. The working group sees common need
patterns in cloud-native application architecture to improve the security of
the systems. Without common ways to programatically ensure consistent policy,
it is increasingly difficult to evaluate system architecture security at scale.
We propose that the creation of open source libraries, if needed, that enable
interoperability across software and providers will enable the adoption of
common protocols for access control. This will in turn accelerate the adoption
of cloud-native application development models, as well as streamline operations
for both cloud and traditional infrastructure.
