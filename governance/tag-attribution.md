# TAG Attribution Guidelines

[Attribution] is the act of ascribing a work to a particular author.

The TAG may be attributed with authorship of a work following a robust
community review and approval process. Depending on the document category, a
work will require different review processes before attribution is possible.

Below is a list of works categories, and what will enable it to be attributed
as a TAG publication.

1. Publications (whitepapers, etc)
  - The document must follow all guidelines, protocols, and processes outlined
    in the [publications] directory.
1. Presentations (conference talks, webinars, etc)
  - The presentation must be made by a TAG Tech Lead or Chair
  - The presentation content must be pre-approved by a majority of TAG Leads
  - No significant concern has been left unaddressed by a TAG Tech Lead
1. Blogs (On the TAG site or elsewhere)
  - The Blog must be directly connected to an initiative such as a whitepaper
    or event.
  - If the blog contains any opinions, advice, or recommendations, it follows
    all guidelines, protocols, and processes outlined in the [publications]
    directory.

## Personal Attribution

A TAG Tech Lead, Chair, or Project Lead may use their title in any internal or
external publication as they see fit. There is no restriction to this, but
the following examples will aid in clarity to avoid mistaken attribution.

### Attribution Qualifier

It is preferable, but not required, that personally attributed works include
a qualifying statement if the CNCF or the TAG is mentioned in the author byline
or article content.

> The author is a leader in CNCF's Technical Advisory Group for Security,
  but this work is the sole opinion of the author and does not represent
  any stance from CNCF or the TAG.

### Good Examples

These examples clearly delineate the author attribution from the author's role

- R. Raccoon - Tech Lead, CNCF TAG Security
- R. Raccoon (Tech Lead, CNCF TAG Security)
- R. Raccoon (CTO, TrashPanda Corp and Tech Lead, CNCF TAG Security)

### Less Good Examples

These examples leave room for misunderstanding whether the article was written
or approved by the TAG.

- R. Racoon - CNCF TAG Security
- R. Racoon (CNCF TAG Security)
- R. Racoon, CNCF TAG Security
- R. Racoon, Tech Lead, CNCF TAG Security
- R. Racoon, TrashPanda Corp and TAG Security
- R. Racoon, TrashPanda Corp, TAG Security
