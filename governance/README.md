# Governance

The governance of the SAFE Working Group (WG) is facilited by
Chairs, Technical Leads, and an active group members (see [roles](roles.md)).

Most of the work of the group is conducted by members outside of WG meetings
(see [process](process.md)). WG meetings serve as a forum for creating a shared
understanding of the cloud native security landscape with regular updates by
WG members on project progress and their own security-related, with on-going
discovery through guest presentations.
