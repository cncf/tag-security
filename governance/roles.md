# Roles within the TAG

The TAG includes several key roles that are critical to the group's success. The
group will have many members, all serving in varying capacities.  Within this
document, "member" may refer to a Chair, a Technical Lead, or other Member
roles.

The following is the current listing of member roles:

* [Three Chairs](#role-of-chairs)
* [Technical Leads](#role-of-technical-leads)
* [Chair Emeriti](#role-of-chair-emeriti)
* [Project Leads](#role-of-project-leads)
* [Team leads](#role-of-team-leads)
* [Group Members](#role-of-members)
* [TOC Liaison](#toc-liaison)
* [Facilitation Roles](#facilitation-roles)

All members are identified in the TAG [README](/README.md), with annotations
where they hold an additional role.

Members fulfilling any Roles in Security TAG are responsible for understanding
and abiding the by the [governance](./) and policies defined in this group. This
commitment and execution of understanding includes not only commits to the repo,
but also to any approvals or direction required by their Role.

**Write access to the repo**: Where applicable, the following roles define
specific areas of the repo or actions on issues where changes require write
access. In any case, governance is not enforced by [access
permissions](github.md), but rather by members who are expected to thoughtfully
consider their actions to support the group.

## Role of members

* The primary role of a member is to contribute expertise to the group.
* To add yourself as a member, submit a Pull Request (PR) adding yourself to the
  list of members.

### Maintaining active members

* Members *SHOULD* remain active and responsive in their Roles.
* Members taking an extended leave of 1 or more months *SHOULD* coordinate with
  other members to ensure the role is adequately staffed during the leave.
* Members going on leave for 1-3 months *MAY* work with other members to
  identify a temporary replacement.
* Members of a role *SHOULD* remove any other members that have not communicated
  a leave of absence and either cannot be reached for more than 1 month or are
  not fulfilling their documented responsibilities for more than 1 month. This
  may be done through a super-majority vote of members, or if there are not
  enough *active* members to get a super-majority of votes cast, then removal
  may occur through a super-majority vote of the Chairs.
* Members contribute to projects, according to the standard group
  [process](process.md).

### Managing membership

* Membership disagreements may be escalated to the Chairs.  Disagreements among
  the Chairs may be escalated to a Security TAG TOC Liaison.
* Members *MAY* decide to step down at anytime and optionally propose a
  replacement.

## Role of chairs

While CNCF TOC allows for Chairs to serve in purely administrative roles, The
Security TAG was formed with deeply technical Chairs based on early need to
navigate a complex security landscape. If the TAG has less than two Technical
Leads, any Chair may act as Technical Lead.

* Primary role of Chairs is to run operations and the governance of the group.
* The Chairs are responsible for ensuring that group meetings are planned and
  facilitated effectively, while also engaging group members in leadership
  roles. Effective facilitation includes (but is not limited to) the following
  activities:
  * setting the agenda for meetings
  * extending discussion via asynchronous communication to be inclusive of
    members who cannot attend a specific meeting time.
  * scheduling discussion of proposals that have been submitted
  * asking for new proposals to be made to address an identified need
  * partnering with Technical Leads to establish a roadmap and manage ongoing
    projects

## Role of technical leads

Technical Leads (TLs) expand the bandwidth of the leadership team. Proposals
must have a TL or Chair working as an active sponsor (as detailed in [TAG
process](process.md)).

The general list of activities for TL are:

* Establish new sub-projects
* Decommission existing sub-projects
* Resolve cross-sub-project technical issues and decisions
* Propose agenda items for meetings to ensure that open issues are discussed
  with the group when needed

TLs are assigned by CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (see [CNCF TAG Tech Lead
nomination and election
process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections)).

## Role of chair emeriti

After a [Chair](#role-of-chairs) finishes their term, they transition into a
role of Chair Emeritus. This allows previous Chairs to continue to chime in and
provide valuable context and contributions to the TAG. A Chair Emeritus can
assume a role of a [technical lead](#roles-of-technical-leads), but in doing so,
must be active in communicating with the co-chairs and technical leads (i.e.
participating in the chair/TL slack and meetings). A Chair Emeritus has the same
permissions/access as technical leads.

## Role of project leads

Project Leads lead specific projects where a deliverable has been defined within
the issue.

Project Leads are nominated and approved by the process defined within our
[governance process](process.md).
  
### On-going projects

On the occasion where a project becomes long term, Project Leads are also given
the OWNER role of the directory or sub-directory along with 1 other nominated
individual to ensure continuity in review and ongoing support of the project.

Depending on the expected length of the project, Project Leads may be assigned
as OWNERS of the project directory or sub-directory in this repository to help
facilitate and moderate new content to the project. The sponsor of the project
or their delegate initiates the PR to create the new directory and update the
OWNERS file.

## Role of Team Leads

Team Leads lead larger streams of work that require sustained effort and
coordination and remain ongoing.

Teams must have a Chair sponsor to maintain visibility in the team's work and to
ensure it is progressing.  The Chair sponsor also provides review and approval
as part of the process whether be on engagement or deliverable publishing (such
as with papers).  

On-going projects may not imply a team, and in such case the leadership role
described below to sustain and coordinate.  The on-going project leadership
position may have an alternate title, such as our initial "Security Assessment
Facilitator."

Team Leads are nominated and approved by the following process:

  1. Team Lead actively participates in the group, initiates the proposal or
     volunteers to lead a stream that has been prioritized by the group
  1. A Chair or TL nominates a candidate.
  1. The nomination is communicated via a pull request annotating the list of
     members in the [TAG README](/README.md) with a link to the issue tracking
     the stream of work. The nomination is typically open for a week (but may be
     shorter with LGTM of at least two Chairs).
  1. Members are encouraged to review any existing, relevant issues and work
     together to ensure the Team Lead is set up for success or suggest
     alternatives.
  1. A sub-directory with a README is created with details on how to get involved.
  1. Team Leads will be given the OWNER role of the directory or sub-directory
     for their team's activities in order to empower merge/approve.

## TOC liaison

The [CNCF TAG](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/tags) process identifies
a TOC Liaison.  The TAG Chairs are responsible for establishing effective
communication with the TOC liaison, including further communication to the wider
TOC upon request.

The TOC Liaison will occasionally prioritize TAG activities, as needed by the
TOC, to further the [CNCF mission](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation).

## Facilitation roles

Members often contribute by working in small groups that research and discuss
options and then share their findings with the rest of the group in a
presentation and typically contribute to the body of work in this repository
(via Pull Request). Some tasks can be effectively executed by simply chiming in
on a github issue and independently contributing a PR without any particular
role or authorization.

This section describes roles where more coordination is helpful and the work
benefits from identifying one or more members who will take on specific
responsibilities.  Our goal is to empower members to move forward independently,
while defining an approval process designed to support communication and
alignment across the wider group.

New roles in this section are typically defined after someone has acted in that
role for some time informally, then proposed as an on-going role by Pull Request
which must be approved by a majority of Chairs.  Process clarifications are
welcome and PRs can be approved by any single Chair.

### Security review facilitator

[Security Reviews](/assessments) are part of the ongoing work of the group and
led by a Security Assessment Facilitator, who will:

* coordinate security review leads for upcoming security assessments.
* identify and recommend security reviewers.
* contribute to process improvements.
* review and merge PRs in the /assessments directory (ensuring co-chair review
  of significant process changes).
* triage issues related to security assessments.

### Meeting facilitator

The group meetings are an important part of community building and the
facilitator ensures a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere. In keeping with these
goals, the meeting facilitator has the following responsibilities:

* prepares the meeting notes with template and agenda
* coordinates with presenter, if applicable
* ensures there are scribes
* runs meeting check-in, including partner groups
* leads the meeting through the agenda

Prerequisites:

* active member
* history of regular attendance

One or more of the following:

* served in another facilitator role
* leader on a project team
* tech lead
* co-chair

Any member who meets the above qualifications is encouraged to add themselves to
the [list of people in this role](/.github/settings.yml).

### Meeting Scribe(s)

Each meeting must have at a minimal one scribe and preferable with two.

Scribe is expected to perform the following:

* Plan to coordinate/review meeting Agenda with facilitator via Slack before
  start of meeting
* Summarize discussions and capture into meeting notes (not transcribe verbatim)
* Clarify and annotate actions as discussion progresses with assignee and due
  dates
* Partner with Facilitator to capture major occurring items in the meeting
* Add links to issues being discussed if not already in Agenda
* Open new issues to track action items from meeting

### Triage team

All members are expected to review Pull Requests (PRs), comment on issues, and
provide meaningful feedback or helpful references.

Members who have contributed regularly, including discussion on multiple PRs and
submitting PRs themselves, can volunteer to participate as a member of the
Triage Team.  Interested members should first join `#tag-security-triage` on
Slack and flag issues that need attention, ask questions and volunteer to take
on process improvement PRs that may arise.

When there is a vacancy or need additional help, they will ask on Slack for
volunteers to officially join the team.

Each member of the Triage Team will:

* assign labels to issues.
* comment where issues need more detail.
* recommend proposals or suggestions for discussion at working session meetings.
* participate on #tag-security-triage slack channel.

### Project teams

Some ongoing projects may have teams where members are identified for additional
roles and may be required to have specific expertise. For visibility, these
additional project roles are listed below:

* [Security Reviewers](../assessments/guide/security-reviewer.md/)
