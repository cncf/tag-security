## Working Group Roles

* [Three Chairs](#role-of-chairs)
* [Technical Leads](#role-of-technical-leads) for each substantive block of work
* Group [Members](#role-of-members)

The group may have many members. Within this document, "member" may refer to a Chair, a Technical Lead, or a Member.

### Role of Members
* The primary role of a member is to contribute expertise to the group.
* Initial members are defined at the founding of the Working Group (WG).
* To add yourself as a member, submit a PR adding yourself to the list of
members.
* Members *SHOULD* remain active and responsive in their Roles.
* Members taking an extended leave of 1 or more months *SHOULD* coordinate with
other members to ensure the role is adequately staffed during the leave.
* Members going on leave for 1-3 months *MAY* work with other members to
identify a temporary replacement.
* Members of a role *SHOULD* remove any other members that have not
communicated a leave of absence and either cannot be reached for more than 1
month or are not fulfilling their documented responsibilities for more than 1
month. This may be done through a super-majority vote of members, or if there
are not enough *active* members to get a super-majority of votes cast, then
removal may occur through a super-majority vote between Chairs and Technical
Leads. Those roles are described below.
* Membership disagreements may be escalated to the WG Chairs.  Disagreements
among the WG Chairs may be escalated to the CNCF Steering Committee.
* Members *MAY* decide to step down at anytime and optionally propose a
replacement.
* The group will use lazy consensus amongst other members with fallback on
majority vote to accept proposal.  The proposal *SHOULD* be supported by a
majority of WG Members.

### Role of Chairs

* Primary role of Chairs is to run operations and the governance of the WG.
* The Chairs are responsible for providing technical guidance, for bringing up
proposals that have been submitted, and for asking for new proposals to be made.
* A chair will serve in their role for 2 years from the time they started in
the role, and *MAY* run again indefinitely.
* To fill a vacancy for a new chair, the group will announce with at least two
weekâ€™s notice that a vote for chair will occur. Each company will have one
vote. Any group member is eligible to run for Chair.
* There will be three chairs and their membership will be tracked in
[`wg.yaml`]().


### Role of Technical Leads

Technical Leads (TLs) will lead larger streams of work that require sustained
technical leadership. Any new proposal should have a TL working as an active
sponsor of the proposal, guiding the proposal with the engagement of community.
The general list of activities for TL are:
  * Establish new subprojects
  * Decommission existing subprojects
  * Resolve cross-subproject technical issues and decisions

There will be two to three TLs and their membership will be tracked in
[`wg.yaml`](). TLs are elected by the following process:
  1. one of the Chairs nominates a candidate to be a TL, and creates a PR that
  adds the TL to [`wg.yaml`]().
  1. Members are invited to comment and vote according to the regular voting
  process described below.

Technical Leads will serve in their role as long as they are necessary. They
can resign at any time. If it's necessary to remove to TL, that will be done by
the WG Chairs. All changes should be reflected in `wg.yaml`.
