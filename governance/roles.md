## Working Group Roles

* [Three Chairs](#role-of-chairs)
* [Technical Leads](#role-of-technical-leads)
* [Project Leads](#role-of-project-leads)
* [Group Members](#role-of-members)
* [TOC Liaison](#toc-liaison)

The group may have many members. Within this document, "member" may refer to a Chair, a Technical Lead, or a Member.

All Members are identified in the SIG [README](/readme.md), with annotations
where they hold an additional role.

### Role of Members
* The primary role of a member is to contribute expertise to the group.
* To add yourself as a member, submit a Pull Request (PR) adding yourself
to the list of members.
* Members *SHOULD* remain active and responsive in their Roles.
* Members taking an extended leave of 1 or more months *SHOULD* coordinate with
other members to ensure the role is adequately staffed during the leave.
* Members going on leave for 1-3 months *MAY* work with other members to
identify a temporary replacement.
* Members of a role *SHOULD* remove any other members that have not
communicated a leave of absence and either cannot be reached for more than 1
month or are not fulfilling their documented responsibilities for more than 1
month. This may be done through a super-majority vote of members, or if there
are not enough *active* members to get a super-majority of votes cast, then
removal may occur through a super-majority vote of the Chairs.
* Membership disagreements may be escalated to the Chairs.  Disagreements
among the Chairs may be escalated to the TOC Liaison.
* Members *MAY* decide to step down at anytime and optionally propose a
replacement.
* Members contribute to projects, according to the standard group [process](process.md).

### Role of Chairs

While CNCF TOC allows for Chairs to serve in purely administrative roles,
SIG-Security was formed with deeply technical Chairs based on early need
to navigate a complex security landscape. Until at least two Technical Leads
are identified, any Chair may act as Technical Lead.

* Primary role of Chairs is to run operations and the governance of the group.
* The Chairs are responsible for
  * setting the agenda for meetings
  * extending discussion via asynchronous communication to be inclusive of
members who cannot attend a specific meeting time.
  * scheduling discussing of proposals that have been submitted
  * asking for new proposals to be made to address an identified need

### Role of Technical Leads

Technical Leads (TLs) expand the bandwidth of the leadership team. Proposals
must have a TL or Chair working as an active sponsor
(as detailed in [SIG process](process.md)).

The general list of activities for TL are:
  * Establish new subprojects
  * Decommission existing subprojects
  * Resolve cross-subproject technical issues and decisions
  * Propose agenda items for meetings to ensure that open issues are
  discussed with the group when needed

TLs are elected by the following process:
  1. One of the Chairs nominates a candidate to be a TL, and creates a PR that
  adds the TL to the [SIG README](/README.md).
  1. Members are invited to comment and vote according to the regular voting
  process described below.

### Role of Project Leads

Project Leads will lead larger streams of work that require sustained
effort and coordination.

Project Leads are nominated and approved by the following process:
  1. Project Lead actively participates in the group, making a proposal or
  volunteering to take on a project that has been prioritized by the group
  1. A Chair or TL nominates a candidate.
  1. The nomination is communicated via a pull request annotating the list of members in the [SIG README](/README.md) with a link to the issue tracking the project. The nomination is typically open for a week (but may be shorter with
  LGTM of at least two chairs).
  1. Members are encouraged to review the tracking issue and work together
  to ensure that the Project Lead is set up for success or suggest alternatives.


## TOC Liaison

The [CNCF SIG](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/sigs) process identifies
a TOC Liaison.  The SIG chairs are responsible for establishing effective
communication with the TOC liaison, including further communication to the
wider TOC upon request.

The TOC Liaison will occasionally prioritize SIG activities, as needed by the
TOC, to further the [CNCF mission](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation).
