# Proposals, projects, and team

In addition to the activities driven by the [CNCF Technical Oversight
Committee][TOC], the work of the group often originates from group members with
ideas on how to reduce risk in cloud native applications in alignment with the
charter of the group and of interest and importance to the community.

This document explains how we transform ideas from our community into projects
with a defined set of deliverables or a team to focus on a larger stream of work
that may involve one or more projects and activities.

## Suggestions, proposals, & presentations

Before creating an issue, review the existing issues to determine if something
already exists that covers or is closely related to what you want to discuss or
present to the group. We have several types of issues that cover different
scenarios.

### Presentations

We love to have presentations about various efforts our members and the greater
community are working on. They allow us to gain insights into new challenges,
upcoming trends, and often inspire our group to take on new projects. It is
important that any content presented to the group must adhere to our
[guidelines](presentations.md). 

### Suggestions

Suggestions are an easy way for someone to suggest something to the group for
which you do not intend to be the project lead of. It is important that you bear
in mind when submitting suggestions that if there is no volunteer to lead
the work will not happen. Mentoring and co-leading are
available to anyone unsure or interested in becoming a project lead, often
suggestions have a limited scope of work and are ideal for individuals looking
to stretch their professional skills.

### Proposals

Proposals are ideas that are intended to become projects, where the submitter
explicitly volunteers to be the project lead. If a proposal is submitted that does not have a
project lead intent checked, it will be converted to a suggestion during triage.


#### Creating, discussing and accepting proposals

Each proposal is unique and might deviate slightly from the process below. For
example, a small addition may not require completion criteria. In general, we
encourage the process below to be followed to ensure that contributions are in
line with the [mission and charter](charter.md).

##### Proposal process

1. **Review existing issues:** [Look at the existing
   issues](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues) and determine if any
   already exist. If an issue already exists that is marked as a suggestion but
   you are interested in leading, comment on the issue and reach out in the
   [#tag-security-triage](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CJX8EBF1D)
   channel to bring attention to it. Skip to ask for collaboration.

1. **Raise an Issue:** [Create an
   issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues/new) that outlines the
   problem to be solved. Use the proposal template if you are interested in
   leading the work and _be sure to complete the project lead intent checkbox_,
   or use the suggestion template if you would like someone else to lead the
   effort. Try to complete the template as much as possible.

1. **Ask the group for collaboration:** Rather than immediately beginning work
   on a solution, bring the issue up for discussion.
   The following guidance shows common steps, though communication often happens
   in different sequence. The key outcome is that there is opportunity for input
   across different channels, with thoughtfulness to accessibility across
   timezone and communication medium. We also encourage outreach outside of the
   group, when there are experts who might share insights (via invited
   presentation) or wish to get involved.

   A) On slack, share the issue link and ask whether others are interested in
   the problem, if so, refer them to the issue which has content on discussions/meetings
   where the issue will be introduced or where to stay tuned for more
   information. provide the issue link and encourage any feedback on your
   proposed solution or activity.

   B) Choose an upcoming meeting where you or another
   group member who is interested in working on the project is able to attend,
   then add the issue to the meeting agenda: include a link and the name of the
   person who will present the proposal in the "Planned Meeting" area of the
   [meeting notes][https://github.com/cncf/tag-security#meeting-times]. Then at
   the meeting:
   * The presenter should screen share the github issue (or ask the meeting
     facilitator ahead of time to do so) and explain the motivation, expected
     outcome, ideas that they have for how it might happen, and ask if others
     have ideas or questions.
   * After a short discussion, people should be invited to chime in on the
     github issue and also mention of they are interested in collaborating. This
     ensures that solutions are created with multiple perspectives as well as
     verifies there is community interest and energy to work on the proposal.

   C) Discussion continues in the github issue for at least one week, usually
   over multiple weeks or sometimes months depending on the level of interest.
   It is sometimes recommended to schedule an initial scoping meeting with
   interested individuals to help refine the scope. We recommend using a doodle
   poll or other polling mechanism in the slack channel to determine everyone's
   availability. If interested in scheduling a meeting but don't have a
   mechanism to conduct the meeting, reach out to the leadership team to have a
   zoom meeting set up.

   The outcome of this conversation will be:
    * Scope may be refined (or questions from the group may need follow-up in
      order to define the scope)
    * Criteria for completion are added to the issue that include a "definition
      of done", ideally with validation by the target audience. Also note in the
      issue if it will be a time-bounded project with a defined deliverable or
      and on-going stream of work -- the latter would typically be proposed only
      after at least one, usually multiple, projects have been completed.
    * At least one person is recommended or nominated as a potential lead --
      usually the author of the proposal.
    * Those interested in working on the solution comment on the issue so
      coordination may begin and set up time or expectations with others to
      begin work.

   Once the scope is defined and a definition of done is described, the
   nominated lead(s) needs to seek out a Chair or Technical Lead to sponsor the
   proposal. 
   * The sponsor reviews the scope and definition of done, determines if it is
     in scope of the roadmap, and updates the issue with the scope and
     definition of done. 
      * Sponsor: takes responsibility to ensure that progress is tracked and
        that outcomes are reported to the group, including proposing to close
        the issue if there is not sufficient activity to sustain the effort.
    * The sponsor presents the proposal for discussion at the next leadership
      meeting to determine roadmap concurrence and group workload.
      * Roadmap: determine there is interest and strong roadmap alignment,
        determine the workload of the group and existing bandwidth to ensure it
        is driven to completion. If the proposal does not fit in the roadmap, it
        does _not_ mean that it cannot be worked.

1. **Accept or close the proposal.**

   A) **Accept**: The sponsor will confirm the project lead(s)and assign
     themselves and the lead(s) to the issue, with members interested in
     contributing noted in the issue descriptions, along with information about
     expected duration, milestones, scope, and anticipated deliverables. An
     accepted proposal becomes an active project (see below) and the "proposal"
     label is removed, the "project" label is added and it is added to the
     backlog.

   B) **Close**: Closure may occur as a result of lack of interest (stale for 90
    days without meaningful activity) or as a result of a consensus to close
    (resulting from any number of factors). If a decision was made to close the
    issue, a github comment on the issue should note the reason and link to
    discussion minutes (when decision is reached at a group meeting) or at least
    two members of the leadership team should be noted in agreement (which may
    include the person who closes the issue).

   C) **Roadmap**: If the issue is in scope of the roadmap but the group cannot
   support the additional workload, the issue will remain a proposal and be
   placed on a roadmap board as "planned and scheduled" with an anticipated
   quarter to begin the work. The roadmap is reviewed quarterly.

### Active projects

1. **Track progress.** As long as work is ongoing, progress should be tracked
   both in the Issue, to the sponsor, and reported on periodically in meetings.
    * Someone working on the project will attend weekly meetings to answer
      questions and provide an update. In case of absence, ensure that github
      issue is updated and another member of the group who can attend the
      meeting is familiar with progress in case questions arise.
    * It's strongly encouraged to include a checklist in the Issue that shows
      what has been done and what work remains and should include a
      retrospective. The issue should also include a link to the meeting notes
      for the work.

1. **Present the work in progress.** Often, prior to the completion of the work,
   it is beneficial to present the work to the broader group to gather a final
   review, solicit additional feedback, or seek recommendations. These should be
   placed in the planned meetings section with a project member as the point of
   contact to present.

1. **Pull Requests.** Completed work should result in a Pull Request (PR). At
   minimum, an update to one of the group documents or roadmap indicating that
   the work was done. Typically projects will result in an artifact that will
   contribute to the information in this repository.

1. **Discuss the work at a meeting.** If an objection to a PR is made either in
   a comment of the PR or during a meeting, the person making the objection and
   the person making the proposal will be given time to present their view at
   the next meeting. If there are not objections, or if all concerns have been
   addressed, and the Pull Request has been stable for 24 hours, a Chair will
   add it to the agenda for an upcoming meeting. Ideally, members who
   contributed to the project will attend that meeting to present their work or
   answer questions.

1. **Vote, if required.** In some cases, there's consensus to accept a PR, and a
   vote is not required. If there’s not consensus among the group, a formal vote
   is required. A comment will be left on the PR prompting members to vote and
   indicating the time the vote will close. Only one member from each company
   should vote. Members will vote by leaving a comment in the Pull Request to
   indicate their vote for or against. Members will have a week after the vote
   begins to leave their vote. Quorum is taken to be 2/3 the number of companies
   who have been active in the past month (via issue comment or meeting
   attendance as recorded in the public minutes).

1. **Support the project going forward.** Some projects require sustainment and
   maintenance to ensure continued relevance for the community.  When work is
   completed, a new issue and corresponding pull request should be created and
   describe the expectations, plans, and ideas for on-going work.  It should
   include historical information and guidelines for contributions and
   maintenance in the README for the project artifact's folder.
