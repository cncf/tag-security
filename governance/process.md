# Agenda, Proposals, Projects, and Teams

In addition to the activities driven by the [CNCF Technical Oversight
Committee][TOC], the work of the group often originates from group members with
ideas on how to reduce risk in cloud native applications in alignment with the
charter of the group and of interest and importance to the community.

This document explains how we transform ideas from our community into projects
with a defined set of deliverables or a team to focus on a larger stream of work
that may involve one or more projects and activities.

## Getting on the agenda

In order to better plan and facilitate meetings, Security TAG has **three** ways
in which a topic may be added to the [Agenda for planned
meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XDmNG1P1YRnidQJEuZFKufaXaIenNHiY-TdYMlt0Un4/edit).

In order to best manage the group's time, consider your topic and the audience,
and select accordingly. If you are unsure, reach out in the
[#tag-security-governance](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0230RW8V2T)
channel.

### Topics and updates

We expect our members working on projects and members of groups to periodically
provide updates to the TAG as part of our longstanding meeting format. If you
are currently working on a project or a member of a group, your updates are
already embedded in the format. If they are not, reach out to
[#tag-security-governance](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0230RW8V2T)
to have them added.

If you have a topic or point of discussion you which to raise which is not:

* already part of an update
* not a proposal or suggestion

but, as part of a working session is:

* seeking input
* probably no more than 15 minutes of discussion
* adhere's to our governance and code of conduct

please add it to the Agenda for a WORKING SESSION with a `[PENDING]` prefix on
the topic, put your name next to it, and let us know by dropping note in the
[#tag-security-governance](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0230RW8V2T)
channel. We will provide feedback if necessary and a member of the leadership
team will help add it to the agenda and remove the `[PENDING]` prefix.
<!-- cSpell:ignore Phippy -->

Example: `[PENDING] Security discussion on why R. Raccoon should be friends with
Phippy â€” R. Raccoon`

We want to foster ad hoc discussions during working sessions, but also recognize
some discussions may take slightly more time than a general question or
informative note.

### Raising an Issue

Anyone is welcome to raise an issue either as a suggestion or as a proposal.

Before creating an issue, review the existing issues to determine if something
already exists that covers or is closely related to what you want to discuss or
present to the group. We have several types of issues that cover different
scenarios.

### Presentations

We love to have presentations about various efforts our members and the greater
community are working on. They allow us to gain insights into new challenges,
upcoming trends, and often inspire our group to take on new projects. It is
important that any content presented to the group must adhere to our
[guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md#present-to-the-tag).

Presentations require a [presentation
issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues/new?assignees=&labels=usecase-presentation%2C+triage-required&template=presentation.md&title=%5BPresentation%5D+Presentation+Title)
to be created.  Please fill this in as completely and accurately as you can,
providing multiple dates for presentations is ideal.

Once a presentation issue is submitted a Security TAG representative will be
assigned to or review the issue to triage the request. Once triaged, the
Security TAG representative will perform due diligence on the issue to ensure it
adhere's to our requirements for presentation content. If the [requirements are
met](../CONTRIBUTING.md#present-to-the-tag), the Security TAG representative will then add the
topic, link the issue, and provide the point of contact and themselves on the
Agenda.

We strive to have no more than two presentations in a given meeting, but prefer
only one to ensure we have ample time for lively discussions.

### Suggestions

Suggestions are an easy way for someone to suggest something to the group for
which you do not intend to be the project lead of. It is important that you bear
in mind when submitting suggestions that if there is no volunteer to lead the
work will not happen. Mentoring and co-leading are available to anyone unsure or
interested in becoming a project lead, often suggestions have a limited scope of
work and are ideal for individuals looking to stretch their professional skills.

### Proposals

Proposals are ideas that are intended to become projects, where the submitter
explicitly volunteers to be the project lead. If a proposal is submitted that
does not have a project lead intent checked, it will be converted to a
suggestion during triage.

#### Creating, discussing and accepting proposals

Each proposal is unique and might deviate slightly from the process below. For
example, a small addition may not require completion criteria. In general, we
encourage the process below to be followed to ensure that contributions are in
line with the [mission and charter](charter.md).

##### Proposal process

1. **Review existing issues:** [Look at the existing
   issues](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues) and determine if any
   already exist. If an issue already exists that is marked as a suggestion but
   you are interested in leading, comment on the issue and reach out in the
   [#tag-security-triage](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CJX8EBF1D)
   channel to bring attention to it. Skip to ask for collaboration.

1. **Raise an Issue:** [Create an
   issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues/new) that outlines the
   problem to be solved. Use the proposal template if you are interested in
   leading the work and _be sure to complete the project lead intent checkbox_,
   or use the suggestion template if you would like someone else to lead the
   effort. Try to complete the template as much as possible.

1. **Ask the group for collaboration:** Rather than immediately beginning work
   on a solution, bring the issue up for discussion. The following guidance
   shows common steps, though communication often happens in different sequence.
   The key outcome is that there is opportunity for input across different
   channels, with thoughtfulness to accessibility across timezone and
   communication medium. We also encourage outreach outside of the group, when
   there are experts who might share insights (via invited presentation) or wish
   to get involved.

   A) On slack, share the issue link and ask whether others are interested in
   the problem, if so, refer them to the issue which has content on
   discussions/meetings where the issue will be introduced or where to stay
   tuned for more information. Provide the issue link and encourage any feedback
   on your proposed solution or activity.

   B) Choose an upcoming meeting where you or another group member who is
   interested in working on the project is able to attend, then add the issue
   to the meeting agenda: include a link and the name of the person who will
   present the proposal in the "Planned Meeting" area of the
   [meeting notes](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security#meeting-times).
   Then at the meeting:

   * The presenter should screen share the github issue (or ask the meeting
     facilitator ahead of time to do so) and explain the motivation, expected
     outcome, ideas that they have for how it might happen, and ask if others
     have ideas or questions.
   * After a short discussion, people should be invited to chime in on the
     github issue and also mention of they are interested in collaborating. This
     ensures that solutions are created with multiple perspectives as well as
     verifies there is community interest and energy to work on the proposal.

   C) Discussion continues in the github issue for at least one week, usually
   over multiple weeks or sometimes months depending on the level of interest.
   It is sometimes recommended to schedule an initial scoping meeting with
   interested individuals to help refine the scope. We recommend using a doodle
   poll or other polling mechanism in the slack channel to determine everyone's
   availability. If interested in scheduling a meeting but don't have a
   mechanism to conduct the meeting, reach out to the leadership team to have a
   zoom meeting set up.

   The outcome of this conversation will be:
    * Scope may be refined (or questions from the group may need follow-up in
      order to define the scope)
    * Criteria for completion are added to the issue that include a "definition
      of done", ideally with validation by the target audience. Also note in the
      issue if it will be a time-bounded project with a defined deliverable or
      and on-going stream of work -- the latter would typically be proposed only
      after at least one, usually multiple, projects have been completed.
    * At least one person is recommended or nominated as a potential lead --
      usually the author of the proposal.
    * Those interested in working on the solution comment on the issue so
      coordination may begin and set up time or expectations with others to
      begin work.

   Once the scope is defined and a definition of done is described, the
   nominated lead(s) needs to seek out a Chair or Technical Lead to sponsor the
   proposal.
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD005 -->
    * The sponsor reviews the scope and definition of done, determines if it is
      in scope of the roadmap, and updates the issue with the scope and
      definition of done.
     * Sponsor: takes responsibility to ensure that progress is tracked and that
       outcomes are reported to the group, including proposing to close the
       issue if there is not sufficient activity to sustain the effort.
    * The sponsor presents the proposal for discussion at the next leadership
      meeting to determine roadmap concurrence and group workload.
     * Roadmap: determine there is interest and strong roadmap alignment,
        determine the workload of the group and existing bandwidth to ensure it
        is driven to completion. If the proposal does not fit in the roadmap, it
        does _not_ mean that it cannot be worked.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD005 -->
1. **Accept or close the proposal.**

   A) **Accept**: The sponsor will confirm the project lead(s)and assign
     themselves and the lead(s) to the issue, with members interested in
     contributing noted in the issue descriptions, along with information about
     expected duration, milestones, scope, and anticipated deliverables. An
     accepted proposal becomes an active project (see below) and the "proposal"
     label is removed, the "project" label is added and it is added to the
     backlog.

   B) **Close**: Closure may occur as a result of lack of interest (stale for 90
    days without meaningful activity) or as a result of a consensus to close
    (resulting from any number of factors). If a decision was made to close the
    issue, a github comment on the issue should note the reason and link to
    discussion minutes (when decision is reached at a group meeting) or at least
    two members of the leadership team should be noted in agreement (which may
    include the person who closes the issue).

   C) **Roadmap**: If the issue is in scope of the roadmap but the group cannot
   support the additional workload, the issue will remain a proposal and be
   placed on a roadmap board as "planned and scheduled" with an anticipated
   quarter to begin the work. The roadmap is reviewed quarterly.

### Active projects

1. **Track progress.** As long as work is ongoing, progress should be tracked
   both in the Issue, to the sponsor, and reported on periodically in meetings.
    * Someone working on the project will attend weekly meetings to answer
      questions and provide an update. In case of absence, ensure that github
      issue is updated and another member of the group who can attend the
      meeting is familiar with progress in case questions arise.
    * It's strongly encouraged to include a checklist in the Issue that shows
      what has been done and what work remains and should include a
      retrospective. The issue should also include a link to the meeting notes
      for the work.

1. **Present the work in progress.** Often, prior to the completion of the work,
   it is beneficial to present the work to the broader group to gather a final
   review, solicit additional feedback, or seek recommendations. These should be
   placed in the planned meetings section with a project member as the point of
   contact to present.

1. **Pull Requests.** Completed work should result in a Pull Request (PR). At
   minimum, an update to one of the group documents or roadmap indicating that
   the work was done. Typically projects will result in an artifact that will
   contribute to the information in this repository.

1. **Discuss the work at a meeting.** If an objection to a PR is made either in
   a comment of the PR or during a meeting, the person making the objection and
   the person making the proposal will be given time to present their view at
   the next meeting. If there are not objections, or if all concerns have been
   addressed, and the Pull Request has been stable for 24 hours, a Chair will
   add it to the agenda for an upcoming meeting. Ideally, members who
   contributed to the project will attend that meeting to present their work or
   answer questions.

1. **Vote, if required.** In some cases, there's consensus to accept a PR, and a
   vote is not required. If thereâ€™s no consensus among the group, a formal vote
   is required. A comment will be left on the PR prompting members to vote and
   indicating the time the vote will close. Only one member from each company
   should vote. Members will vote by leaving a comment in the Pull Request to
   indicate their vote for or against. Members will have a week after the vote
   begins to leave their vote. Quorum is taken to be 2/3 the number of companies
   who have been active in the past month (via issue comment or meeting
   attendance as recorded in the public minutes).

1. **Support the project going forward.** Some projects require sustainment and
   maintenance to ensure continued relevance for the community.  When work is
   completed, a new issue and corresponding pull request should be created and
   describe the expectations, plans, and ideas for on-going work.  It should
   include historical information and guidelines for contributions and
   maintenance in the README for the project artifact's folder.
