# Proposals, projects, and team

In addition to the activities driven by the
[CNCF Technical Oversight Committee][TOC], the work of the group often
originates from group members with ideas on how to reduce risk in cloud native
applications in alignment with the charter of the group and of interest and
importance to the community.

This document explains how we transform ideas from our community into
projects with a defined set of deliverables
or a team to focus on a larger stream of work that may involve one or more
projects and activities.

## Creating, discussing and accepting proposals

Each proposal is unique and might deviate slightly from the process below. For
example, a small addition may not require completion criteria. In general, we
encourage the process below to be followed to ensure that contributions are in
line with the [mission and charter](charter.md).

### Proposal process

1. **Raise an Issue:**

[Create an issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues/new)
that outlines the problem to be solved. Use the proposal template if you
are interested in leading the work, or suggestion template if you would like
someone else to lead the effort. If possible, include:

    * The customer impact of the problem
    * The scope of the work required

1. **Ask the group for collaboration:** Rather than immediately beginning work
on a solution, bring the issue up for discussion. The following guidance shows
common steps, though communication often happens in different sequence. The
key outcome is that there is opportunity for input across different channels,
with thoughtfulness to accessibility across timezone and communication medium.
We also encourage outreach outside of the group, when there are experts who
might share insights (via invited presentation) or wish to get involved.

   A) On slack, share the issue link and ask whether others are interested in
   the problem and have feedback on your proposed solution or activity.

   B) Choose an upcoming meeting where you or another group member who is
   interested in working on the project is able to attend, then add the issue
   to the meeting agenda: include a link and the name of the person who will
   present the proposal in the "Planned Meeting" area of the
   [meeting notes][https://github.com/cncf/tag-security#meeting-times].
   Then at the meeting:
   * The presenter should screen share the github issue (or ask the meeting
   facilitator ahead of time to do so) and explain the motivation, expected
   outcome, ideas that they have for how it might happen,
   and ask if others have ideas or questions.
   * After a short discussion, people should be invited to chime in on the
   github issue and also mention of they
   are interested in collaborating. This ensures that solutions are created
   with multiple perspectives as well as verifies there is community interest
   and energy to work on the proposal.

   C) Discussion continues in the github issue for at least one week, usually
   over multiple weeks or sometimes months.

   The outcome of this conversation will be:
    * Scope may be refined (or questions from the group may need follow-up
    in order to define the scope)
    * Criteria for completion are added to the issue that include a "definition
    of done", ideally with validation by the target audience. Also note in the
    issue if it will be a time-bounded project with a defined deliverable or
    and on-going stream of work -- the latter would typically be proposed only
    after at least one, usually multiple, projects have been completed.
    * At least one person is recommended or nominated as a potential lead.
    * Those interested in working on the solution comment on the issue so
    coordination may begin and set up time or expectations with others to
    begin work.
    * A Chair or Technical Lead proposes this as a roadmap proposal or
    agrees to act as a "sponsor."
      * Sponsor: takes responsibility to ensure that progress
      is tracked and that outcomes are reported to the group, including
      proposing to close the issue if there is not sufficient activity to
      sustain the effort.
      * Roadmap: determine there is interest and strong roadmap alignment,
      but that there is not enough bandwidth to be confident that this work
      can be driven to completion.

1. **Accept or close the proposal.**

   A) **Accept**: assign to the Sponsor and the Project Lead(s) working on the
   effort, with members interested in contributing noted in the issue
   descriptions, along with information about expected duration, milestones,
   scope, and anticipated deliverables. An accepted
   proposal becomes an active project (see below) and the "proposal" label
   is removed, the "project" label is added and it is added to the backlog.

   B) **Close**: a github comment on the issue should note the reason and
    link to discussion minutes (when decision is reached at a group meeting)
    or at least two members of the leadership team should be noted
    in agreement (which may include the person who closes the issue).

   C) **Roadmap**: the issue will remain a proposal and be placed on a
   roadmap project board. The roadmap is reviewed quarterly.

### Active projects

1. **Track progress.** As long as work is ongoing, progress should be tracked
both in the Issue and reported on periodically in meetings.
    * Someone working on the project will attend weekly meetings to answer
  questions. In case of absence, ensure that github issues is updated and
  another member of the group who can attend the meeting is familiar with
  progress in case questions arise.
    * It's strongly encouraged to include a checklist in the Isssue
  that shows what has been done and what work remains and should include a
retrospective.

1. **Pull Requests.** Completed work should result in a Pull Request (PR).
At minimum, an update to one of the group documents or roadmap indicating that
the work was done. Typically projects will result in an artifact that will
contribute to the information in this repository.

1. **Discuss the work at a meeting.** If an objection to a PR is made either in
a comment of the PR or during a meeting, the person making the objection and
the person making the proposal will be given time to present their view at the
next meeting. If there are not objections, or if all concerns have been
addressed, and the Pull Request has been stable for 24 hours, a Chair will add
it to the agenda for an upcoming meeting. Ideally, members who contributed to
the project will attend that meeting to present their work or answer questions.

1. **Vote, if required.** In some cases, there's consensus to accept a
proposal, and a vote is not required. If thereâ€™s not consensus among the group,
a formal vote is required. A comment will be left on the proposal prompting
members to vote and indicating the time the vote will close. Only one member
from each company should vote. Members will vote by leaving a comment in the
Pull Request to indicate their vote for or against. Members will have a week
after the vote begins to leave their vote. Quorum is taken to be 2/3 the number
of companies who have been active in the past month (via issue comment or
meeting attendance as recorded in the public minutes).

1. **Support the project going forward.** Some projects require sustainment and
   maintenance to ensure continued relevance for the community.  When work is
completed, a new issue and corresponding pull request should be created and
describe the expectations, plans, and ideas for on-going work.  It should
include historical information and guidelines for contributions and maintenance
 in the README for the project artifact's folder.
