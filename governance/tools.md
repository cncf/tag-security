# Tools

This document contains a set of tools that will be useful to security reviewers and project leads. This is not an endorsement of any vendor or open source project, rather a collection of what has been useful to individuals to help share helpful suggestions to others in the group.

## Document conversion

Documents, such as [self-assessments] are sometimes initially drafted in a Google doc, which facilitates discussion. At the end of the
review, the documents needs to be converted to markdown so that they can be added to the github repository.
