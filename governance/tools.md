# Tools

This document contains a set of tools that will be useful to security reviewers
and project leads. This is not an endorsement of any vendor or open source
project, rather a collection of what has been useful to individuals to share
helpful suggestions to others in the group.

## Document conversion

Documents, such as [self-assessments] are sometimes initially drafted in a
Google doc, which facilitates discussion. At the end of the review, the
documents needs to be converted to markdown so that they can be added to this
GitHub repository.
