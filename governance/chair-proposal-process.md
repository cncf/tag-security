# SIG-Security Chair proposal process

1) SIG-Security Co-chairs operate as a team. The Co-Chair team seeks to maintain full coverage of the leadership capabilities across the key qualities of industry experience, hands-on cloud-native and security experience, as well as administrative experience needed to run a SIG-Security.
2) If a clear successor for the exiting Co-Chair exists based on the merit of their contributions ("chop wood, carry water") and relevant experience that will benefit the SIG, based on the SIG's collective experience over time, the exiting Co-chair may nominate a successor.
3) The exiting Co-Chair should propose the desired successor to the other Co-Chairs. If there are any objections, the Co-Chair will have the opportunity to propose another worthy candidate. If SIG-Security Chairs, Tech Leads and TOC Liaisons are unable to put forward a candidate, then a selection process will need to be agreed upon and executed.
4) Upon unanimous consent amongst the current Co-Chairs, the Co-Chairs will ask the TOC Liaisons to propose the candidate for the TOCâ€™s vote in accordance with the [SIG Chair election process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/sigs/cncf-sigs.md#elections).
5) If no new Chair candidate is available, the role will remain vacant until the Co-chair's, TOC Liaisons or CNCF TOC propose a replacement.
