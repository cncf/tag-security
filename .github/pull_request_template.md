# Repo Move!!

Hello contributor!  This repo is being migrated into https://github.com/cncf/toc and https://github.com/cncf/contribute-site.  If you're thinking of opening a PR here, you should probably open it over there instead.

## Mappings

* If you're editing `community/assessments/projects` for a self-assessment or joint assessessment, your new location is:

  https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/projects/<yourproject>/security-assessment/...

* If you're updating published resources in `community` outside the assessments, your new location is:

  https://github.com/cncf/contribute-site/tree/main/docs/community/tags/security-and-compliance

* If you're editing other content, it probably should go to:

  https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/tags/tag-security-and-compliance/


Thanks!
