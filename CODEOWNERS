# CODEOWNERS file indicates code owners for certain files
#
# Code owners will automatically be added as a reviewer for PRs that touch
# the owned files.
#
# The master branch will be configured to require at least 1 approval from a 
# code owner for a PR.
#
# Actions by community members should follow the following guidelines:
# https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/blob/master/governance/github.md

# Global code owners: co-chairs, tech leads
# Note: Tech leads can perform approval and merging of PRs, with the intent
# of delegating some responsibilities from co-chairs. 
#
# Tech lead, Chair Emeritus roles should exercise discretion in defering final
# approval for a PR to a co-chair. 
# This includes major edits or new introductions to the repository.
