Dynamic analysis of deployed infrastructure may include detecting Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and IAM configuration drift, validating the expected network attack surface, and ensuring that a SOC can detect unusual behavior in dedicated test environments to configure alerting for production. Dynamic analysis is considered to be a part of testing however, it is expected to occur in a non-production runtime environment.
