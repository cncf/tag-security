Registries should accommodate technologies to sign and verify OCI artifacts. It is also important to ensure that the
caching and distribution tools also provide the capability to sign, encrypt and provide checksums to ensure that the
caching layer can detect tampering or attempts to poison the dataset.

The [CNCF Storage Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ayeALoU5jrO5x96N7bqXmLx0O-rAIh2HllZBgtYwz3Q/edit?usp=sharing)
provides additional background on the concepts, terminology, usage patterns and technology classes of cloud native storage.
