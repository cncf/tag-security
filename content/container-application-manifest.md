Application manifests describe the configurations required for the deployment of containerized applications. As mentioned in the Security Benchmarks section, guides such as the NIST 800-190 publication offer recommended security practices and configurations for application containers. It is vital to scan application manifests in the CI/CD pipeline in order to identify configurations that could potentially result in an insecure deployment posture.

## Examples

- Examples of application manifests are Kubernetes YAML files, that are sent to the Kubernetes API server to deploy an application.
- Some of the security policies that could be enforced on Kubernetes YAML files are:
  - Prohibit container images that use the “latest” tag
  - Prohibit container images from specified registries
  - Prevent all containers from running as “root”
  - Ensure all containers specify cpu and memory limits
  - Require all ingresses to have TLS configured
  - Prevent services from creating external load balancers
