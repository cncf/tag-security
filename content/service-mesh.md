## Examples
- Firstly service mesh provides security functions such as Mutual TLS, Authentication, Authorization, Observability and Logging and Micro-segmentation and Traffic Management.
- Additionally, service mesh provides these capabilities without any change to the application. In other words applications can leverage these capabilities without making any changes to the application itself. 
- Policies can be applied uniformly using a single control plane, while being pushed and enforced in a decentralized manner.
