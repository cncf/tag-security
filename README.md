## Objective

STAG facilitates collaboration to discover and produce resources that enable
secure access, policy control, and safety for operators, administrators,
developers, and end-users across the cloud native ecosystem.

## Background

“Cloud Native” is open source cloud computing for applications — a complete
trusted toolkit for modern architectures. There are multiple projects which
address key parts of the problem of providing access controls and addressing
safety concerns. Each of these adds value, yet for these technical solutions to
be capable of working well together and manageable to operate they will need a
minimal shared context of what defines a secure system architecture.

## Vision

There is a future where operators, administrators and developers feel confident
creating new cloud native applications. They use cloud technologies with clear
understanding of risks and the ability to validate that their security policy
decisions are reflected in deployed software.

We envision that there could exist an ecosystem of tools that can simplify the
experience of cloud native operators, administrators and developers, including:

1. System security architecture that understands and accommodates the ever
   growing heterogeneity of systems and provides a framework to protect
   resources and data while servicing their users.
2. Common vocabulary and open source libraries that make it easy for developers
   to create and deploy apps that meet system security requirements.
3. Common libraries and protocols that enable people to reason about the
   security of the system, such as auditing and explainability features.

## Governance

[STAG charter](governance/charter.md) outlines the scope of our group
activities, as part of our [governance process](governance) which details how we
work.

## Communications

Anyone is welcome to join our open discussions of STAG projects and share news
related to the group's mission and charter. Much of the work of the group
happens outside of Security TAG meetings and we encourage project teams to share
progress updates or post questions in these channels:

Group communication:

- [Email list](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-tag-security)
- [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) #tag-security channel

Leadership:

- To reach the leadership team (chairs & tech leads), email
  cncf-tag-security-leads@lists.cncf.io
- To reach the chairs, email cncf-tag-security-chairs@lists.cncf.io

### Slack governance

### On-going projects

#### Policy team

Policy is an essential component of a secure system.

[Bi-weekly meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ihFfEfgViKlUMbY2NKxaJzBkgHh-Phk5hqKTzK-NEEs/edit?usp=sharing)
at 3:00 PM PT focus on policy concerns and initiatives.

Co-leads

- TBD

Co-chair representative: @achetal01

#### Security reviews

[Security reviews](./assessments) are a collaborative process for the benefit of
cloud native projects and prospective users by creating a consistent overview of
the project and its risk profile.

Facilitator: Justin Cappos ([@JustinCappos](https://github.com/JustinCappos)),
New York University

Co-chair representative: @lumjjb

#### Software Supply Chain Security

Software Supply Chain attacks have come to the wider community's attention
following recent high-profile attack, but have been an ongoing threat for a long
time. With the ever growing importance of free and open source software,
software [supply chain security](./supply-chain-security) is crucial,
particularly in cloud native environments where everything is software-defined.

Weekly meetings at 8:00 AM PT (50 min) (see your
timezone [here](https://time.is/0800_today_in_PT?CNCF_Security_TAG_Supply_Chain_WG_Meeting))
See [CNCF calendar](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/) for invite.

Facilitator for current deliverables is listed on
the [issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues/679)

## Additional information
