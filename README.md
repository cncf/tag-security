## About Us

The CNCF Security Technical Advisory Group facilitates collaboration to exchange and produce knowledge and resources for building security in the cloud native ecosystem.

Cloud Native involves building, deploying, and operating modern applications in cloud computing environments, typically using open source. This complex ecosystem presents a technology risk landscape that demands rethinking application and information security through the lens of developer experience.

We aim to significantly reduce the probability and impact of attacks, breaches, and compromises. By empowering developers and operators to understand and manage the security posture of their systems, we strive to fulfill the promise of enhanced productivity and operational efficiency.

## Key Focus Areas

- **System Security Architectures**: Frameworks to protect resources and data.
- **Common Lexicon, Templates & Libraries**: Tools for developers to create secure apps.
- **Heuristics and Models**: Approaches for reasoning about system security.

### Working Groups

The TAG's working groups focus on specific areas and organize most community activities, including weekly meetings.
These groups facilitate discussions, engagement, and publications with key stakeholders, operating differently based on their needs.
Each group, led by a responsible leader, reaches consensus on issues and manages logistics. All materials, such as reports, white papers, documents, and reference architectures, are in the repository's /community directory.
