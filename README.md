## Objective

The CNCF Security Technical Advisory Group facilitates collaboration to discover and produce resources that enable
secure access, policy control, and safety for operators, administrators,
developers, and end-users across the cloud native ecosystem.

## Background

Cloud Native describes the building, deploying, and operating of modern applications in cloud computing environments, typically using open source. This complex ecosystem composed of different open source projects presents an increasingly complicated technology risk landscape.
While there are several projects in the cloud native ecosystem that address trust, safety, and security in the dynamic interplay between the different layers of infrastructure and application services, the technological shift demands application and information security be rethought through the lens of developer experience as close to applying software engineering to design for security considerations in the effort to safeguard an integrated cloud native ecosystem as a whole.

## Vision

We believe in a future where the probability and impact of attacks, breaches, and compromises are significantly reduced. Where the most common risks of today are not just mitigated but made implausible. We believe developers and operators can be empowered to understand better and be reassured by the posture of the systems they build and run through the informed use of cloud technologies with clear
understanding of responsibility and risks and the unlocked ability to validate that their architectural intent meets compliance and regulatory objectives.

<!-- cSpell:ignore sociotechnical -->
There is a growing ecosystem of tools that promises to unlock developer productivity and operational efficiency. We strive to fulfill the human side of the sociotechnical equation to acceleration and attain that promise including:

1. Consumable system security architectures that account for the ever
   growing heterogeneity of systems and provides a framework to protect
   resources and data while servicing their users.
2. Common lexicon and open source libraries that make it easy for developers
   to create and deploy apps that meet system security requirements.
3. Common libraries and protocols that enable people to reason about the
   security of the system, such as auditing and explainability features.

## Publications

TAG Security has published several resources for the community, which can be
found under [publications](publications/README.md).

### On-going projects

#### Compliance Working Group

[Compliance Working Group](./compliance) is cross-disciplinary and focused on bridging purely technical issues to broader legal and regulatory workflows:
not only the prevention of system breaches, but also considering supply chain, operators, data and AI failures while simultaneously considering auditability,
non-repudiation, legally required forensic evidence, etc. - across all the various activities required of cloud native operators of all sizes.
The Compliance WG plans to curate vendor neutral tools for evidence collection, chain-of-custody in audits, as well as automated workflows for continuous compliance authoring and assessment.

Weekly meetings at 10:00 AM ET (60 min) [Check My Time](https://mytime.io/10am/ET)

See [CNCF calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=0b8u5el8ta4s93t2cm72tuvhhk@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles) for invite.

#### Security reviews

[Security reviews](./assessments) are a collaborative process for the benefit of
cloud native projects and prospective users by creating a consistent overview of
the project and its risk profile.

Facilitator: Justin Cappos ([@JustinCappos](https://github.com/JustinCappos)),
New York University

Co-chair representatives: @PushkarJ @eddie-knight

#### Software Supply Chain Security

Software Supply Chain attacks have come to the wider community's attention
following recent high-profile attack, but have been an ongoing threat for a long
time. With the ever growing importance of free and open source software,
software [supply chain security](./supply-chain-security/README.md) is crucial,
particularly in cloud native environments where everything is software-defined.

Weekly meetings at 8:00 AM PT (50 min) (see your
timezone [here](https://time.is/0800_today_in_PT?CNCF_Security_TAG_Supply_Chain_WG_Meeting))
See [CNCF calendar](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/) for invite.

Facilitator for current deliverables is listed on
the [issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues/679)

## Additional information

### CNCF Security TAG reviews

As part of
the [CNCF project proposal process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process)
projects should create a
new [security review issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues/new?assignees=&labels=assessment&template=security-assessment.md&title=%5BAssessment%5D+Project+Name)
with a
[self-assessment](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/assessments/guide/self-assessment.md)
.
