## Objective

SIG-Security facilitates collaboration to discover and produce resources which enable secure access, policy control and safety for operators, administrators, developers, and end-users across the cloud native ecosystem.

## Background

“Cloud Native” is open source cloud computing for applications — a complete trusted toolkit for modern architectures (CNCF presentation).  There are multiple projects which address key parts of the problem of providing access controls and addressing safety concerns. Each of these adds value, yet for these technical solutions to be capable of working well together and manageable to operate they will need a minimal shared context of what defines a secure system architecture.

## Vision

There is a future where operators, administrators and developers feel confident creating new cloud native applications.  They use cloud technologies with clear understanding of risks and the ability to validate that their security policy decisions are reflected in deployed software.

We envision that there could exist an ecosystem of tools that can simplify the experience of cloud native operators, administrators and developers, including:
1. System security architecture that understands and accommodates the ever
growing heterogeneity of systems and provides a framework to protect resources
and data while servicing their users
2. Common vocabulary and open source libraries that make it easy for developers
to create and deploy apps that meet system security requirements
3. Common libraries and protocols that enable people to reason about the
security of the system, such as auditing and explainability features.

# Governance

[SIG-Security charter](governance/charter.md) outlines the scope  of our group activities, as part of our [governance process](governance) which details how we work.

## Communications

Anyone is welcome to join our open discussions of SIG-Security projects and share news related to the group's mission and charter. Much of the work of the group happens outside of SIG-Security meetings and we encourage project teams to share progress updates or post questions in these channels:

* [Email list](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-sig-security)
* [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) #sig-security channel
