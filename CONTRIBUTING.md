### Reviewing Pull Requests

If you are new to the group, reviewing pull requests and commenting on issues
is a great way to get involved!

Except for urgent or very small grammar or spelling fixes, we leave pull 
requests open for at least 24 hours, so that others have the chance to 
review/comment.   

Anyone who reviews a pull request should leave a note to let others know that 
someone has looked at it.  Any change should have a +1 from someone else.
Larger changes should have multiple reviewers.

### Writing style

Consistency creates clarity in communication. 

* Common terms
  * When referring to users and use cases, ensure consistency with [use cases](usecases.md)
  * See [CNCF Style
  Guide](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/style-guide.md) for
  common terms. Note that the following terms are not hyphenated and all lower
  case, except for capitalizing the first letter when at the beginning of a
  sentence:
    * open source
    * cloud native
* Additional Formatting
  * Headlines, page titles, subheads and similar content should follow sentence
    case, and should not include a trailing colon.
  * Paragraphs do not start with leading indent. 
  * Wrap lines at 80 characters, except where it would break a link. No need to 
    reformat the whole paragraph to make it perfect -- fewer diffs are easier for
    reviewers.

If you find yourself correcting for consistency, please propose additional style
guidelines via pull request to this document. Feel free to add references to 
good sources for content guidelines below.
