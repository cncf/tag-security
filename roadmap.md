# SIG Security Roadmap

### Overview
Note:  SIG-Security was rebranded from SAFE working group. The below roadmap includes SAFE WG and SIG-Security in its timeline.

|     | #2 Discover | #3 Describe | #4 Identify
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Artifacts | Personas<br/>Use Cases<br/>Categories | Standards<br/>Common Definitions<br/>Block Architecture | Catalog Projects<br/>Fill in Boxes<br/>Identify Gaps
| Topics | Presentations<br/>SIG members & guests | Standards in Practice<br/>Real World Systems Architecture | Platforms & Products<br/>Tools & Libraries

### Details

1. **Charter** the SAFE Working Group. Draft vision, process and initial members 
   (done, see below)
2. **Discover** (in progress)
   * Explore the problem space of the working group
   * Investigating what is happening in the community today with respect to security for cloud native applications and infrastructure
   * [Presentations](issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue+label%3Ausecase-presentation+) from members & guests
   * Describe [personas & use cases](safe_usecases.md)
   * Draft a picture or set of categories that will serve as a starting point for an evaluation framework
   * Solicit real world use cases and practices (and compensating controls) for projects
3. **Describe** the landscape
   * Define the terminology used in the output documents, and in the community
   * Describe the current state (landscape) of cloud native security, which might include:
      * existing standards
      * existing open source, and proprietary, solutions
      * common patterns in use today for system that works for cloud-native apps. For example:
        * Extract end-to-end view of secure access, and
        * Common layering or a block architecture
4. **Identify** existing security components in CNCF and projects in the CNCF landscape and catalog
   * Identify gaps and make recommendations to the community and TOC
   * Continually monitor the viability of the existing projects and update the landscape document
   * Document and disseminate best practices (provide training?)
