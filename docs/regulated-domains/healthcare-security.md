## Context

Cloud-native and blockchain-based systems are increasingly used in healthcare and mental wellness. These systems must follow strict privacy and security practices due to the sensitivity of personal health information (PHI/PII).

## Principles

- **Data minimization:** Never place PHI/PII directly on public chains or in unencrypted logs.  
- **Incident readiness:** Define break-glass procedures, rotation plans, and clear audit trails.  
- **Mental wellness risk:** Misuse or leakage of mental health data has higher ethical stakes; systems must exceed baseline privacy standards.  

## Checklist

- [ ] No PHI/PII in logs, storage, or transactions.  
- [ ] Consent captured via VCs/DIDs with expiration + nonce.  
- [ ] Cloud-native deployments include encryption at rest and in transit.  
- [ ] Break-glass access is gated and logged.  
- [ ] Testing covers reentrancy, replay, and denial-of-service threats in consent flows.
